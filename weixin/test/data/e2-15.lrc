[00:07.632] Rabbit wanted to have a picnic.
[00:09.110] But it was raining.
[00:11.305] Rabbit saw Mouse.
[00:11.305] ->http://localhost/test/data/img/02.png
[00:13.654] “I don’t like the rain,” he said.
[00:14.970] “Come and sit under my umbrella,” said Mouse.
[00:16.254] But the umbrella was too small.
[00:17.389] Mouse wanted to have a picnic with Rabbit.

[00:19.006] But it was raining.
[00:21.112] They saw Skunk.
[00:22.583] “We don’t like the rain,” said Rabbit.
[00:24.289] “Come sit in my tent,” said Skunk.
[00:25.674] ->http://localhost/test/data/img/04.png
[00:25.674] But the tent was much too small.
[00:28.016] Skunk wanted to have a picnic with Mouse and Rabbit.
[00:30.760] But it was raining hard.
[00:30.760] ->http://localhost/test/data/img/05.png
[00:32.102] They saw Moosling.
[00:34.459] “We want to have a picnic, but we don’t like the rain,” Rabbit said.
[00:36.421] “Do you have a big tent, Moosling?” said Skunk.
[00:36.421] ->http://localhost/test/data/img/06.png
[00:37.958] “No, I don’t have a tent,” Moosling said.
[00:39.904] “Do you have a big umbrella?” said Mouse.
[00:41.218] “No, I don’t have a big umbrella,” said Moosling.
[00:41.218] ->http://localhost/test/data/img/07.png
[00:42.574] “But I am big,” he said.
[00:45.922] “I like the rain. And I love picnics! Come and sit under me!”
