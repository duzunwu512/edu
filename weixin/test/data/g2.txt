as close as they can
to the fire.

a tank in the truck.
Or it can come
from a fire hydrant.

most fires with water.
But they can put out
fires with foam, too.

This truck can spray foam.
It sprays the foam
if a car or an airplane
is on fire.

This truck can fight wildfires.

Sometimes a truck can not
get to a big fire.

I make plants grow.
I can melt snow and ice!”

“How can we tell
who is stronger?”

“He is wearing a coat.
I will make his coat come off.
I can blow it right off his back!
Can you make his coat
come off?”

“I like that contest,” said Sun.
“I’m sure I can make
his coat come off.
You go first,”

“I’ll hide behind that cloud.”

Sun went behind a cloud
to watch.
Wind blew. Wind blew harder.
Wind blew so hard that
the man’s hat came right off.
But his coat
did not come off.

The man just grabbed his hat
and tied it on tight.
He put on his gloves,
and he traveled on.

Wind blew even harder.
He blew as hard as he could.
The man pulled his coat
tighter around him,
and he traveled on.

behind the cloud.
“It’s my turn now,” he said.

it is for me to make the man
take off his coat.”

and began to shine.
“It is so warm,”
said the man.
He took off his hat.

Sun kept shining.
Sun got very hot.
The man got hotter and hotter.
“I feel really warm,” said the
man, and he took off his gloves.

Sun got as hot as he could.
“It’s much too warm
to wear this coat,”
said the man, and
he took off his coat.

“I win the contest!”
said Sun to Wind.
“I made the man take off his coat,
so I am stronger than you.”
“Yes, you are,” agreed Wind.
And he turned into a little breeze.

071 The Problem
with Meli

Here comes Meli. Meli is
Ron’s dog.

Meli is a happy little dog. Her
tail is always wagging. She’s a good
dog, too–most of the time.

But sometimes Meli doesn’t do
what Ron tells her to do.
It’s 6 o’clock and Ron is cooking
dinner. He hears Meli barking
and barking.

“Shh, Meli. Be quiet,” Ron says.
But Meli barks and barks.

“Why are you barking?” Ron
asks. He looks out the window. He
can’t see any dogs outside. He looks
out the door, but no one is there.

Meli barks again.
“Do you need to go outside?”
Ron asks. He opens the door. But
Meli just sits and looks up at him.
She does not need to go out.

Then she barks again and again.
Ron can not get her to stop barking.

The next night, Meli barks again.
“Meli, please stop that barking!”
Ron says. But Meli just runs around
in circles and barks louder.

Meli barks every night at
dinnertime. She is very loud! It
hurts Ron’s ears.
Ron doesn’t know what to do.
So he calls Karen.

Dog trainers teach dogs how
to be good pets. And they
teach dog owners how to
get their dogs to do what
they want them to do.

Karen is a dog trainer. She knows
all about dogs. She tells Ron, “I think
Meli is bored. Dogs need a lot of
exercise. Try this. Take her for a long
walk at 4 o’clock every day. Take her
out before she starts barking.”

That day, Ron takes Meli for
a long walk. When they get home,
Meli lies down on her red blanket.
She doesn’t bark that night.

The next day, Ron plays with
Meli for a long time in the afternoon.
Later, Meli doesn’t bark at all.
Karen was right!
After that, Ron gives Meli more
exercise.
Meli doesn’t bark at dinnertime
again, until . . .

One night, Ron is in the kitchen.
“Woof! Woof! Woof! Woof!”
It’s Meli.
“Oh, no!” says Ron. “Not again!”

But this time, Meli is barking at
the TV.
“Oh!” says Ron. “It’s a dog show!
Good girl, Meli! Let’s watch the dogs
together.”

She was taking a bath.
“Moosling, please!” she cried.
“Stop following us all the time!”

“Sorry!” said Moosling.

Then Moosling forgot
all about Mouse.
He saw new footprints!
They were not like any
of the other footprints.

He followed them up and down
and this way and that way.
But he couldn’t find the animal
who had made them.

Moosling saw Hoot up in a tree.
“Hoot, you are wise,” said Moosling.
“Who made these footprints?”
“Go look in the pond
and you will see,” said Hoot.

Moosling ran to the pond
and looked in.

“I made those footprints!”
Moosling said.
Then he laughed,
and Hoot laughed, too.

liked to brag a lot.
“I’m the fastest animal of all!” he
would say. “No one could ever beat
me in a race!”

believed him.
“You talk so much,” said the Frog,
“that you don’t have time to race.”

Squirrel.

“You are the slowest animal of all!”
“I’m not joking,” said the Tortoise.
So the two agreed to race the
next morning.

Animals from near and far heard
about the race. By the next morning,
a crowd had gathered.
Everyone was sure the Hare would win.
After all, he was the fastest animal.
But everyone hoped the Tortoise
would win. After all, he was the
kindest animal.
Soon, the Hare and the Tortoise were
at the START line.

The Frog rang the bell, and the
race began. The Hare took off like a
rocket! He ran past the Tortoise and
called, “Good-bye, Tortoise! This will
be a very easy race for me!”
The Tortoise walked slowly along the
path. “I will not listen to the Hare,”
he thought. “Let him say what he
wants. I will just keep going.”

The Hare was near the FINISH line.
When he looked back, he could hardly
see the Tortoise. “This is such a silly
race!” he said. “That slow Tortoise
could never beat me. I can take my
time and still win the race.”

So the Hare stopped to eat some
leaves. Then he drank some cool water
from the lake. He ate and drank until
he was very full.

The Hare started to feel sleepy.
“I think I’ll take a little nap,” he said.
“The Tortoise is very far behind. I can
rest and still win the race!”

So the Hare sat down and closed his
eyes. Soon he was fast asleep. He
dreamed that he won the race.

Meanwhile, the Tortoise walked slowly
along the path. He had walked all
day. He was very tired, but he didn’t
stop. Soon he walked right past the
sleeping Hare!

“Is that the FINISH line?” the Tortoise
thought. “Yes, it is! All the animals are
cheering! I’m almost there!”

All the cheering woke up the Hare.
“What is going on?” he asked. Then
he saw that the Tortoise was almost at
the FINISH line. “Oh, no! This can’t
be happening. No one could ever beat
me in a race!” he said.

The Hare jumped up. He ran as fast
as he could. But it was too late. The
Tortoise crossed the FINISH line and
won the race!

“I can’t believe that you beat me!”
said the Hare.
The Tortoise smiled and said quietly,
“Slow and steady wins the race.”
And after that, the Hare never
bragged again.

076 Wide Awake!
	 It was very late. Mother and
Father were in bed.

	 Andy was fast asleep. But Roxy
was wide awake. She looked at the
moon. She watched Andy sleep. She
looked at the cracks in the wall.

	 “Mother!” Roxy called. Mother ran
into the room.
“I can’t sleep!” Roxy said. “Will
you read one more book? Maybe
then I’ll fall asleep.”

	 Mother read one more book.
“Now go to sleep, Roxy,” she said.

	 Roxy closed her eyes. She flopped
onto her back. She rolled onto her
belly. She flopped onto her back
again. But she just could not
fall asleep.

	 “Father!” Roxy called. Father
ran in.
“I’m thirsty,” said Roxy. “Maybe
a glass of milk will help me go
to sleep.”

	 Father got a glass of warm milk,
and Roxy drank every drop.
“Goodnight, Roxy,” said Father.
“Go to sleep now.”

	 Roxy pushed her blankets off.
She pulled them back on. She
pushed them off and pulled them on.
Then she threw the blankets on
the floor.

	 “Mother! Father!” Roxy called.
Mother and Father both ran in.
“Try counting, Roxy. Count as
high as you can!” said Mother.	
“Then start over!” said Father.

	 Roxy started counting. Mother
and Father went back to bed.
Soon the house was very quiet.	
Then . . .

	 “Mother! Father! Mother!
Father!” Roxy shouted. “I counted to
100. I did it ten times! That’s
a million, I think!”	
Andy came into the room. “Why
is everybody up?” he said.


	 “We’re all wide awake,” said
Father. “Let’s have a snack.”
Andy, Roxy, and Mother sat down
at the kitchen table. Father made
a snack.

	 “Have some toast and jam,”
said Father.	
“Thank you,” said Mother.	
“Thank you,” said Andy.

	 But Roxy didn’t say a thing.	
She was fast asleep.

077 All About
The Sonoran
Desert

The Sonoran Desert is very hot
and very dry.
For most of the year,
it does not get any rain.
Yet many plants and animals
live in this desert.
The Sonoran Desert

This tall plant is a cactus.
The cactus can live here
because it stores water
in a special way.
When it rains, the cactus
roots soak up water.
The plant swells up
and gets bigger.
The cactus uses the water
until it rains again.
Plants of the Desert

This small plant is a cactus, too.
When the cactus is little,
it grows in the shade
of a taller plant.
A plant that helps a cactus grow
is called a “nurse” plant!

The cactus has very long spines.
The spines help shade the plant
from the hot sun.

This desert plant
has no leaves.
The plant dropped its leaves
to save water.

Here is the same kind of plant
after the rain.
Now the plant is covered
with new green leaves.

Many animals make their homes
in the Sonoran Desert.
The animals find ways
to stay cool on very hot days.
Some animals find places
to hide when the sun is very hot.
Animals of the Desert

The javelinas (ha vah LEE nahz)
rest in the shade
of a cactus plant.

The desert tortoise
may dig deep into the dirt
to stay cool.
The tortoise also finds shade
under large rocks.

The tortoise gets some water
by eating the fruit
of a cactus plant.

These desert animals
have a different way
to stay cool.
They have long ears
that let out
the heat.

Desert birds have
other ways to cool off.
This bird lifts up its feathers
to stay cool.

An elf owl stays cool
inside a cactus plant.

Some birds make nests
inside a cactus plant.
They stay inside the cactus
during the heat of the day.
They come out at night
to hunt for food.


Desert Rain
The Sonoran Desert doesn’t
get much rain.
But when rain does fall,
desert plants burst into bloom.
Then the desert is full of color!

078 The
Bird Feeders
Nana loved to watch birds.
She tossed seeds on the ground.
Birds came to eat the seeds,
and Nana watched them
hop and peck and flap.

But sometimes the birds
didn’t get the seeds.
“Look at those squirrels!”
Nana said. “They are eating all
the seeds.”

“We can fix that,” said Rose.
“We’ll make a bird feeder,”
said Matt.
Rose and Matt made a bird
feeder. They set it up outside in
the yard.

“Now you can watch the
birds again,” Rose said.

But the squirrels still came
to eat the seeds.
“Those squirrels!” Nana cried.
“Look at them climb that pole.
They’re taking the birds’ food.”

So Rose and Matt cut some
tin. They made a cone and put
it on the pole.

“Now the squirrels can’t climb
the pole,” said Rose.

But the squirrels still got to
the feeder.
“Look at that squirrel jump!”
Nana cried. “It jumped all the
way from the tree to get the
seeds.”
“We’ll fix that,” Rose said.
“How?” Nana asked.
“I don’t know,” Rose said.

Rose and Matt made more
bird feeders. They made feeders
that twirled and feeders that
tipped and feeders that swung.
They made one feeder that had
balloons and pinwheels, too.

They hung up all the bird
feeders. Then they watched.
Squirrels climbed.
Squirrels swung.
Squirrels leaped.

“That’s the best one!” Rose
said. She pointed at the biggest
feeder. “The birds can use it,
but the squirrels can’t,” she said.
So Rose and Matt took
down all the other feeders.

The birds looked happy.
But Nana looked a little sad.
“I think Nana misses the
squirrels,” Matt said.
“They were fun to watch,”
said Rose.

So they put all the feeders
back up. Then the birds and the
squirrels all had plenty to eat.
And everyone loved to watch
them, until . . .

“Oh, no!” Nana cried.
“Look at that bear!”

079 The Ugly
Duckling

One day, a mother duck felt her eggs begin
to shake. One by one, the eggs cracked open.
Eight yellow ducklings poked out their heads.

“Peep, peep,” they said.
“Quack, quack!” said Mother Duck.
But one egg did not crack—one very big egg.

Mother Duck sat on the big egg for a few
more days. Finally, it cracked open. Out popped
a big bird.
“Oh!” said Mother Duck. “You do not look like
my other ducklings, but I am your mother, and
I love you.”

The little yellow ducklings made fun of the
new bird.
“You do not look like us,” they said. “You are
big and gray. You are an ugly duckling.”
This made the new bird very sad.
“You do not look like my other ducklings,”
said Mother Duck, “but I am your mother,
and I love you.”

The ugly duckling looked for someone
to play with. He went to the farm pond.
“Will you swim with me?” he asked.
“No,” said the ducklings. “You are too ugly.”
“No,” said the frogs and turtles. “You are an
ugly duckling.”

Then he tried the farmyard.
“Will you play with me?” he asked.
“No, no,” said the horses. “You are too ugly.”
“No,” said the pigs, and they laughed at him.
The sad, ugly duckling went back to the
farm pond.

“No one will play with me,” he said to
Mother Duck. “I am too ugly.”
“You do not look like the other ducklings,”
said Mother Duck, “but I am your mother,
and I love you.”
But the ugly duckling was not happy. So he
flew away.

Soon, the ugly duckling found a small pond.
No one could say he was ugly.
No one could make fun of him.

Time passed, and the ugly duckling grew up.
His wings were wider.
His neck was longer.
His feathers had turned white.
He had changed, but he did not know it.

Then one day, two big white birds flew over
the pond.
“What beautiful birds!” thought the ugly
duckling. “I hope they stop to visit.
I am lonely.”
The birds flew lower and lower and landed in
the pond with a splash.

“Hello,” said the ugly duckling. “Who are you?”
“We are swans,” said the big white birds,
“just like you.”
“I am not a swan,” said the ugly duckling.
“I am an ugly duckling.”
The swans laughed. “Look down at the water,”
they said. “What do you see?”

The ugly duckling looked down at the water.
“You are right!” he cried. “I am
a beautiful swan!”

The ugly duckling was very happy to be a
beautiful swan. He flew off at once to visit
the farm.
“Hello,” he said. “Do you remember me?”
“No!” said the ducks.
“No, no!” said the frogs and turtles.
“We’ve never seen you before,”
sniffed the horses and pigs.

“I am the ugly duckling!” cried the swan.
All the animals said, “You are too beautiful to
be the ugly duckling.”
“I grew up to be a beautiful swan,”
he said.
All the animals were happy to be with such
a beautiful bird.

Then the swan saw Mother Duck.
“Hello! I am your ugly duckling,” he said.
Mother Duck did not care if he was a
duckling or a swan. She said, “You do not
look like my other ducklings, but I am your
mother, and I love you.”

080 The Boss

It was Sunday morning.
Mom was sick in bed.

“Mom needs more orange juice,”
Dad said. “I’ll go to the store
and get some for her. I’ll be right
back. Be good while I’m gone.”

“Dad is gone,” said my
big brother. “Now I’m the boss.”
“I want to be the boss,”
said my little sister.

“We can take turns.
You go first,” I told my
big brother.

“OK,” he said.
“Let’s make breakfast for Mom.
Let’s make her some toast.”

I put peanut butter
on the toast. My brother put
grape jelly on top. Then my
sister added chocolate chips.
“Mom can eat the toast
when she wakes up,”
said my brother.

“Now it’s my turn to be the
boss,” I said. “Let’s make a
card for Mom.”
My brother got some paper,
and I got the paint. We wrote,
“Get Well, Mom.”

My sister painted flowers.
She got some blue paint
on the card. She got some blue
paint in her hair!

“My turn!” said my little
sister. “Now I’m the boss.
I want balloons for Mom.”

My brother and I just smiled.
Our little sister loved balloons.
My brother got a balloon
and blew it up.
“Bigger!” my sister shouted.
So he blew some more.
He blew and blew until…

POP!
My sister screamed.
“Oh, no!” I said.
Mom woke up. She came
running into the room.
“What’s going on?” Mom asked.

“We took turns being the boss,”
I said.
“I see,” said Mom.
Mom saw the toast
and the card. She saw the
popped balloon. Then Mom saw
my sister’s blue hair.

Mom laughed and laughed.
“Now I’m the boss,” she said.
“Let’s clean up this mess!”




=====================================================
081 The Fun Club Goes
to the Aquarium

Miss Dimple wanted to take the
Fun Club to the beach, but it was too
cold and wet.
“I have an idea,” Miss Dimple said.
“Let’s go to the aquarium.”
“Is an aquarium a place to see fish?”
Rich asked.
“You’ll see fish,” Miss Dimple said,
“and a lot more!”

The first animals they saw were harbor
seals. Some of the seals were swimming and
diving. Other seals lay on rocks.
“Seals aren’t fish,” Dana said. “They are
mammals. I can see their hair!”

“Look at their f lippers,” Rich said.
“They look like my swim fins.”
“Those f lippers are like swim fins,”
Miss Dimple said. “They help seals swim.”

They stopped next at a big tank.
Keb read the label. “‘Sea Jellies.’ They do
look like jelly!” he said.
“They are just blobs with long tails,”
Rich said. “They don’t even have bones!”

“Those tails are called tentacles,” Miss
Dimple said. “Tentacles help jellies catch food.
And some tentacles can sting. The sting helps
keep jellies safe.”

The next tanks had sea dragons in them.
“First we see jellies, and now dragons!
Where are the fish?” Rich asked.

Dana read the label. “Sea dragons are a kind
of fish!” she said.
Keb watched the animals wave in the water.
“They look more like seaweed than fish!” he said.

Next, Miss Dimple led them to a very big
tank. It was three stories tall! They saw sharks
and sea turtles and eels. Small fish darted in
and out of caves in a reef at the bottom of
the tank.

“The tank is so big,” said Rich. “Where
does all the water come from?”
A man heard his question. “Pipes bring
water from the sea,” he said. “Seawater gets
pumped through the tanks each day.”
“Do you work here?” asked Miss Dimple.
“Yes,” the man said. “My name is Stan.
And I love to tell people about the aquarium.”

Rich looked in another tank. He saw a
diver. “Look!” he said. “A diver is swimming
with a sea turtle! What a great job!”
“It’s a big job,” Stan said. “Divers care for
the plants and animals in the tanks. They help
keep the tanks clean, too.”
“What other jobs do people do for the
aquarium?” Dana asked.

“Some people collect plants and animals
for the tanks. Others make sure the plants and
animals stay well. We have a hospital where
we care for hurt or sick animals.”

“Some workers feed the animals. And people
have to keep all these tanks working well.”
“What do you do?” Dana asked.
“I’ll show you,” Stan said.

He took them to a tide pool. “I made
this,” he said.
“I love tide pools!” Keb said. “Look at the
starfish! Look at the crabs!”
“Are those rocks real?” Rich asked.

“No,” said Stan. “We leave real rocks and
reefs in the ocean for the plants and animals
that live there. We made these rocks the size
and shape we needed. And they are easy to
clean and move.”

“Look inside the cracks in the rocks,”
Dana said. “Some animals are hiding in them!”

“Many animals live in tide pools,” Stan
said. “But a tide pool is not an easy place
to live. The sea comes in and goes out twice
a day. Sometimes water covers the animals.
Sometimes the sun bakes them. Big waves can
wash animals away. Birds can come and eat
them. People sometimes take animals away
from tide pools, too.”

“I have to take you away from this
tide pool,” Miss Dimple said. “It’s time to
go home now.”
They all thanked Stan, who asked them
to come back any time.

Miss Dimple said, “If the sun comes out
tomorrow we can go to the beach. And if
it doesn’t . . .”

“We can come back to the aquarium!” they said.

082 The Singing
Duck

Once there was a little duck.
He was very happy
to be a duck.
He liked being a duck.

He liked his webbed feet.
They helped him swim
as fast as a fish.
He liked his sleek feathers.
They helped him stay warm
when he got wet.

He liked his duck bill.
It helped him catch bugs
and other good things to eat.
But there was one thing
the little duck didn’t like.
He didn’t like his quack.

“Why can’t ducks sing
like other birds?”
the duck asked his mother.
“All we do is quack,
quack, quack!”

“Quack!” said his mother.
“Quack, quack, quack!”
“I want to make music,”
the duck said to himself.
“Maybe I can learn to sing!”

So the duck left his pond.
He waddled down a path
on his webbed feet.
He waddled under the trees.
Bird songs filled the air.

The duck saw a bluebird
in a bush.
“Tweet-tweet-tweet!”
sang the bird.
“Tweet-tweet-tweet!”

“Hello, bird!” said the duck.
“I like your song.
Will you teach me to sing?”
The bluebird looked
at the duck.
“Well, thank you,” she said.
“But why do you want to sing?
You’re a duck! Ducks quack.”

“I don’t want to quack,”
said the duck sadly.
“I want to make music.
Please teach me to sing.”
The bluebird was a kind bird.
She wanted to help
the little duck.
“All right,” said the bluebird.
She lifted her head.
She opened her beak wide.
She began to sing.

“Tweet-tweet-tweet!” she sang.
“Now you try it!”

The duck lifted his head.
He opened his duck bill wide.
He began to sing.
“Quack! Quack! Quack!” he sang.
“Quack, quack, quack, quack!”

“Well,” said the bird.
“I see I was wrong.
Ducks can sing!
I have never heard a duck
sing as well as you!”
That was quite true,
because the bluebird
had never heard a duck
sing at all.

“Are you sure?” asked the duck.
“Was I really singing?
It sounded like quacking to me.”
“I’m sure you were singing,”
said the bird.
“You were happy and
you were singing.
Your quack is your song.”

“Thank you, thank you!”
quacked the duck.
He waddled back to the pond
as fast as his webbed feet
could carry him.

And from then on,
the duck loved everything
about being a duck.




=====================================================
084 How Bear
Lost His Tail

Long ago, Bear had a long, bushy tail.
He was so proud of his tail that he showed
it off to everyone.
The other animals would say,
“Bear, you have the most beautiful tail of all.”

This made Fox unhappy. He thought his own
long, bushy tail was the most beautiful tail
of all. So Fox made a plan.
Fox knew that Bear loved fish more than
anything else. So Fox cut out a hole in
the ice.

He fished all day long until he had a great
big pile of fish. When he heard Bear coming,
Fox hid the fishing pole and dipped his tail
into the cold, icy water.

Just then, Bear walked by the lake. He couldn’t
believe what he saw—a great big pile of fish!
“Fox,” he said. “How did you get all those
beautiful fish?”

“It was easy,” said Fox. “I caught them with
my tail. I’ll show you. But let’s find a new place
for you. I think I’ve caught all the fish here.”
So Fox led Bear to a different place and cut
out a new hole.

“Here is your new hole, Bear,” said Fox.
“Turn around and dip your tail into the water.
Soon a fish will grab it.”
Bear turned his back to the hole and dipped
his beautiful tail into the water.
“I cannot see the hole. How will I know if I
catch a fish?” asked Bear.

Fox said, “I will hide over there so the fish
don’t see me. When I see a fish grab your tail,
I will shout to you. Then you can pull the fish
out of the water. Don’t move until I tell you to.”
Bear nodded his head.

So Bear waited and waited. He was very tired.
Soon he fell asleep.
Bear slept all day and all night. His tail got
colder and colder. The ice got thicker and
thicker. Bear slept and slept.

Fox waited by the tree. He waited until Bear
had slept all night long.
At last it was time. Fox crept up to Bear’s ear
and shouted, “NOW, BEAR!”

Bear woke up and pulled his tail, but
it wouldn’t move.
“Pull harder,” said Fox. “It must be
a HUGE fish.”
Bear pulled and pulled, until . . . SNAP!

Bear turned around to see the huge fish he
had caught. But that is not what he saw.
“My tail,” cried Bear. “My big, beautiful tail!”


The fishing hole was gone. There in the ice
was Bear’s tail. The water had frozen while
Bear slept, and his tail was stuck in the ice.

Fox pointed at Bear’s new short tail and laughed.
“What a silly little tail for a great, big bear,”
said Fox.

Bear was sad. He didn’t want the other animals
to see his short little tail, so he ran home to
his cave and slept all winter long.
Now Fox shows off his own beautiful tail
every chance he gets!




=====================================================
084 The Wise
Blackbird

Once there was a bluebird
who liked to brag.
He looked at the sky,
he looked at his wings,
and he smiled.
“How fine I look!”
thought the bluebird.
“I am as blue as the sky!”
The bluebird flew high and low
in the blue sky.

The bluebird saw a mouse.
“Hello!” said the bluebird
to the mouse.
“It is a beautiful day,
isn’t it?”
“Yes, it is a beautiful day,”
said the mouse.
“The sky is a beautiful blue.”

“I am blue, too,”
said the bluebird.
“I am beautiful,
like the blue sky.”
“Oh,” sighed the mouse.
“I am not blue. I am gra
I am not the color
of the sky.”
The bluebird laughed
and flew away.

The bluebird saw a flamingo.
“Hello!” said the bluebird.
“It is a beautiful day,
isn’t it?”
“Yes,” said the flamingo.
“It is a fine and sunny day.”
“Look at the beautiful blue sky,”
said the bluebird.
“I am blue, like the sky.”
“I am pink,”
said the flamingo.

“Blue is better than pink,”
bragged the bluebird.
“Blue is the color
of the sky!”
“Oh,” said the flamingo.
“I am not the color
of the sky.”
The flamingo was angry.
He flew away
without saying good-bye.

The bluebird looked up.
He saw a blackbird
at the top of a tree.
“Hello!” said the bluebird.
“It is a beautiful day,
isn’t it?”
“Yes it is,”
said the blackbird.
“I am blue,
like the sky,”
said the bluebird.
“I am not blue,”
said the blackbird.
“I am black.”

“Blue is better than black,”
bragged the bluebird.
“Blue is the color
of the sky.”

The blackbird was wise.
“Yes, blue is beautiful,”
he said.
“Blue is the color
of the sky.”
“But the sky is not always blue.
Sometimes it is gray,
like a mouse.
Sometimes it is pink,
like a flamingo.
Sometimes it is black,
like me.”

The bluebird was surprised.
“When is the sky gray,
like a mouse?” he asked.
“The sky is gray
on a cloudy day,”
said the blackbird.
“It is as gray as a mouse.”

“When is the sky pink,
like a flamingo?”
asked the bluebird.
“The sky is pink at sunset,”
said the blackbird.
“It is as pink as a flamingo.”

“When is the sky black,
like you are?”
asked the bluebird.
“The sky is black at night
when the stars are shining,”
said the blackbird.
“It is as black as I am.”

The bluebird thought and thought.
He thought about the gray mouse
and the sky on a cloudy day.
He thought about the pink flamingo
and the sky at sunset.
He thought about the blackbird
and the sky at night.
“You are right,”
he said to the blackbird.
“A mouse is as gray as the sky.
A flamingo is as pink as the sky.
A blackbird is as black as the sky.
And I am as blue as the sky.”

“We are all the colors of the sky.
We are all beautiful.”
The bluebird still liked being blue,
but he never bragged again.

085 African
Elephants
All About

Introduction
This animal has a trunk and tusks.
It has wrinkled skin and big ears.

It has big feet with pads on the bottom.
It lives in Africa. It is an African elephant!


Elephants are the biggest animals living
on land. They can weigh as much as a truck!
The biggest elephants live in Africa.

An Elephant’s Body
An elephant has a long trunk. The
trunk is an elephant’s nose and lip. But an
elephant also uses its trunk like a hand.

An elephant can pick up a tiny leaf or a
big branch with its trunk. Sometimes an
elephant uses its trunk to take a shower!

All African elephants have tusks. Tusks
are long teeth that don’t stop growing. These
elephants use their tusks to dig holes. They
also use them to carry things. An elephant
will even rest its trunk on its tusks.

African elephants have big ears.
On hot days, elephants flap their ears
to cool off.

An elephant’s skin is wrinkled. It looks
very tough, but it is not. Elephants can get
bug bites and sunburns. An elephant protects
its skin by covering it with mud or dirt.

Elephants have big feet with pads
on the bottom. The pads let the elephant
walk quietly.

An Elephant’s Life
Elephants eat about 300 pounds of food
a day. They eat grass, plants, fruit, and
parts of trees. Elephants reach high with
their trunks to get the best leaves.

Elephants cannot talk, but they do make
sounds. Elephants roar, rumble, growl, and
make a sound like a horn. They also make
some very low sounds that people
can’t hear.

Female elephants and babies live in
family groups. An older female elephant leads
the family.

Elephants are very good mothers.
They take good care of their own babies.
They also watch out for the other babies in
their group.

More Elephant Facts
✸ Elephants can call to each other
from miles away.
✸ Elephant babies suck their trunks.
✸ Elephants can live for 70 years or more.

086 Redwood Trees
by Eric Michael
All About
Tall Trees
Redwood trees are very tall.
The trees are taller than a house.
They are taller than most buildings.
They are the tallest trees of all.

Why do redwood trees grow so tall?
They grow as long as they live. And
they live a very long time. Redwood
trees can live 2,000 years!

Where Redwood Trees Grow
Redwood trees grow by the sea.
The weather there is just right
for them. It is not too cold or
too hot. There is a lot of rain
and fog by the sea. Redwood trees
grow well in rain and fog.

Bark and Seeds
Redwood trees have thick bark.
Bugs do not like redwood bark. It
has a bad taste. The thick bark helps
protect the trees from fire, too.

Redwood trees are very big.
But redwood seeds are small.
A redwood seed is as small
as a tomato seed.

Saving Redwood Trees
This redwood tree has a big hole
for cars to drive through. People do
not cut holes in redwood trees today.

087 The City Mouse
and the
Country Mouse

There was a city mouse. She went to visit
her friend in the country.
City Mouse had never been to the country
before. The grass was green, and the air
smelled fresh.
“I think I will like the country,” she thought.

Country Mouse served a fine meal. She thought
the food was delicious.
But City Mouse did not agree. “Country food
is different from city food,” said City Mouse.
“Come visit me in the city. You will love
city food.”

“I will visit you soon,” said Country Mouse.
“But now it is late. Let me show you your
bed in the barn.”
Country Mouse had made her friend a bed
in the hay, right next to her own. Country
Mouse thought the hay was warm and cozy.

But City Mouse did not agree. “This feels
like pins and needles!” she thought. “How can
anyone sleep in hay?”
“Come visit me in the city,” said City Mouse.
“You will love city beds.”

“I will visit you soon,” said Country Mouse.
Then she yawned and fell asleep.
City Mouse could not sleep at all. The hay
poked her and pinched her all night long. In
the morning, City Mouse said good–bye and
happily went back to the city.

The next month, Country Mouse visited her
friend in the city.
The buildings were tall, and the people were
busy. “I think I will like the city,” thought
Country Mouse.
“Come in,” said City Mouse. “But please
hurry! We have to run.”

City Mouse and Country Mouse ran. Finally,
they stopped in a big room. City Mouse
waved her arm grandly. “Here we are!”
she said.
Country Mouse looked around her. She had
never seen so much food before.

“Have a taste of sugar,” said City Mouse.
“Mmmm,” said Country Mouse, licking her
lips. “It is so sweet!”
“Try some butter,” City Mouse said.
“OH!” said Country Mouse. “It is so delicious!”
The little mouse ate and ate. She felt like the
luckiest mouse in the world!

Just then, City Mouse squeaked, “Run!”
“What’s wrong?” cried Country Mouse.
“The people are here!” yelled City Mouse.
“Run into that hole!”
The little mice ran as fast as they could
into a hole in the wall. Country Mouse was
shaking with fear.

“That was terrible!” said Country Mouse.
“Does that happen all the time?”
“Oh,” said City Mouse. “You get used to it
after a while.”
Country Mouse did not think that she could
ever get used to it. City life was just too
scary for her.

The mice sat inside the wall.
“We can have a nap here,” said City Mouse.
“This is nicer than your scratchy old hay bed.”
Country Mouse didn’t agree. But, tired
from so much running, she closed her eyes
and slept.
When the mice woke up, it was quiet.

“Let’s go back out!” said City Mouse.
In the kitchen, the mice saw big plates
of food everywhere.
Country Mouse sniffed and nibbled one
delicious dish after another.
Then Country Mouse saw a beautiful piece
of cheese in the corner.

“OH—I want some of that cheese!” Country
Mouse said.
“STOP!” cried City Mouse. “Don’t eat it!
It’s a terrible trap!”
Country Mouse stopped. “What’s a trap?”
she asked.
“When you take the cheese, something comes
down on your head—hard!” said City Mouse.

Country Mouse jumped to the floor.
“I think I’ll go home now, City Mouse,” she
said. “In the country, I never have to worry
about traps coming down hard on my head!
Good–bye!”

So Country Mouse went home.
She smelled the fresh air, she ate in peace,
and she slept in the warm, cozy hay. She was
happy to be a country mouse.
But she did dream about her visit to the city.
She dreamed about sugar, and butter . . .
and cheese.

89  The Fun Club Goes
to the Aquarium

Miss Dimple wanted to take the
Fun Club to the beach, but it was too
cold and wet.
“I have an idea,” Miss Dimple said.
“Let’s go to the aquarium.”
“Is an aquarium a place to see fish?”
Rich asked.
“You’ll see fish,” Miss Dimple said,
“and a lot more!”


The first animals they saw were harbor
seals. Some of the seals were swimming and
diving. Other seals lay on rocks.
“Seals aren’t fish,” Dana said. “They are
mammals. I can see their hair!”

“Look at their f lippers,” Rich said.
“They look like my swim fins.”
“Those f lippers are like swim fins,”
Miss Dimple said. “They help seals swim.”

They stopped next at a big tank.
Keb read the label. “‘Sea Jellies.’ They do
look like jelly!” he said.
“They are just blobs with long tails,”
Rich said. “They don’t even have bones!”

“Those tails are called tentacles,” Miss
Dimple said. “Tentacles help jellies catch food.
And some tentacles can sting. The sting helps
keep jellies safe.”

The next tanks had sea dragons in them.
“First we see jellies, and now dragons!
Where are the fish?” Rich asked.

Dana read the label. “Sea dragons are a kind
of fish!” she said.
Keb watched the animals wave in the water.
“They look more like seaweed than fish!” he said.

Next, Miss Dimple led them to a very big
tank. It was three stories tall! They saw sharks
and sea turtles and eels. Small fish darted in
and out of caves in a reef at the bottom of
the tank.

“The tank is so big,” said Rich. “Where
does all the water come from?”
A man heard his question. “Pipes bring
water from the sea,” he said. “Seawater gets
pumped through the tanks each day.”
“Do you work here?” asked Miss Dimple.
“Yes,” the man said. “My name is Stan.
And I love to tell people about the aquarium.”

Rich looked in another tank. He saw a
diver. “Look!” he said. “A diver is swimming
with a sea turtle! What a great job!”
“It’s a big job,” Stan said. “Divers care for
the plants and animals in the tanks. They help
keep the tanks clean, too.”
“What other jobs do people do for the
aquarium?” Dana asked.

“Some people collect plants and animals
for the tanks. Others make sure the plants and
animals stay well. We have a hospital where
we care for hurt or sick animals.”

“Some workers feed the animals. And people
have to keep all these tanks working well.”
“What do you do?” Dana asked.
“I’ll show you,” Stan said.

He took them to a tide pool. “I made
this,” he said.
“I love tide pools!” Keb said. “Look at the
starfish! Look at the crabs!”
“Are those rocks real?” Rich asked.

“No,” said Stan. “We leave real rocks and
reefs in the ocean for the plants and animals
that live there. We made these rocks the size
and shape we needed. And they are easy to
clean and move.”

“Look inside the cracks in the rocks,”
Dana said. “Some animals are hiding in them!”

“Many animals live in tide pools,” Stan
said. “But a tide pool is not an easy place
to live. The sea comes in and goes out twice
a day. Sometimes water covers the animals.
Sometimes the sun bakes them. Big waves can
wash animals away. Birds can come and eat
them. People sometimes take animals away
from tide pools, too.”

“I have to take you away from this
tide pool,” Miss Dimple said. “It’s time to
go home now.”
They all thanked Stan, who asked them
to come back any time.

Miss Dimple said, “If the sun comes out
tomorrow we can go to the beach. And if
it doesn’t . . .”

“We can come back to the aquarium!” they said.

090 Old Jacket,
New Jacket

Mom held up a faded
blue jacket.
“This jacket looks like it will
fit you, Iris,” said Mom.

Iris looked at the jacket.
It was her sister’s old jacket.
Dana always wore it
with her jeans.

Iris shook her head.
“I don’t want that old thing,”
said Iris.
“I want a new jacket
to wear with my jeans.”
“But this is a good jacket,”
said Mom.
“It will look good on you, Iris.”

At first, Iris felt sad.
Then she felt mad.
Dana’s old jacket was
not the same as a new one.
Iris wanted a jacket
that was just for her.


Iris stared at the jacket.
She wanted to make it special.
What could she do?
She put a heart pin on it.
That didn’t look right.
But the pin gave Iris an idea.

“Mom, can I use some things
in your sewing box?” Iris asked.
“Sure,” said Mom.
Iris opened the sewing box.
She took out some red cloth
and some white cloth.

She cut the red cloth in the
shape of a heart.
“Oh, I see what you are doing,”
her mom said.
“Do you want some help?”

“Yes, please,” said Iris.
“I want red hearts
and white stars.”
“Okay,” said Mom.
“You cut out the hearts.
I’ll sew them on.”

Iris cut out three red hearts.
Her mom put one heart
on the back of the jacket.
She put two hearts
on the front of the jacket.

Then Mom cut out lots of stars.
She put them on the front of
the jacket and on the back, too.
Iris looked at the jacket
and started to feel happy!

Mom took some gold beads
out of a jar.
“Would you like some beads
on your jacket?” she asked.
“Oh, yes!” said Iris.
“Red hearts and white stars
and gold beads.
That will be beautiful!”

“Here is your new jacket,”
Mom said to Iris at last.

Iris put on the jacket.
She looked at the back,
and she looked at the front.
She liked what she saw.
Iris loved her new jacket.

Just then Dana came in.
“Nice jacket!” said Dana.
“Can I have one, too?”
she asked Mom.
“It’s easy,” said Iris.
“Just get an old jacket
and make it brand new!”

091 From Milk
to Ice Cream

A Sweet Treat
Ice cream is cold. Ice cream is
sweet. Ice cream is a yummy treat.
Many people love to eat ice
cream. Throughout the world, ice
cream is a popular dessert.

Ice cream is made from milk
that comes from cows. The cows
live on dairy farms.

At the Farm
Cows need a lot of food and
water to make milk. They nibble on
grass, and they eat hay and grains.
Cows also drink plenty of water
each day.
Dairy farmers give their cows
all the food and water they need.
A healthy cow can fill about one
hundred glasses of milk in one day!

Cows are milked twice a day.
On small farms, farmers milk the
cows by hand. On big farms,
machines do all the milking. The milk
is pumped into special tanks. The
tanks keep the milk clean, cool,
and fresh.

On the Truck
Trucks pick up the milk from the
farms. The trucks have huge tanks
that keep the milk cold. The trucks
take the milk to factories where
some of it is made into ice cream.

A truck takes the milk to a factory.

At the Factory
At an ice cream factory, the
milk is separated into cream and
skim milk. Then the cream and milk
are put together with sugar and
other things. This makes an ice
cream mix.
The ice cream mix is heated to
kill any germs. A machine makes the
mix smooth. Then the mix goes to
another tank to cool.

A worker checks the ice cream
mix on its way to be heated.

Another machine whips the mix.
This makes the ice cream taste rich
and creamy. Then it is time to add
flavorings, such as chocolate or
vanilla. Treats such as fruit, nuts,
and cookies can go in, too.

A worker adds cookie dough.

Strawberries
and bananas

Cookie dough
Nuts
Cookies

Next, the ice cream goes into
containers. Then it is cooled again.
This time the ice cream is frozen
until it is very hard. The ice cream
must not melt on the way to
the stores.

Finally, the ice cream is shipped
in special trucks that keep it cold.
The trucks deliver the ice cream to
stores where people can buy it.

The next time you enjoy some
ice cream with friends, tell them how
it is made. It is fun to learn how
the milk from dairy cows becomes
the ice cream that you eat.

092 Frog Songs

Froggy loved to sing. He sang in
the shower, and he sang on his lily pad.
Sometimes, he sang to the moon.

One morning, Froggy heard a song. He
looked up. Some birds were sitting in the
branches of a tree. They were singing a song
together.

Tweet, tweet, tweet!

“What a beautiful song,” Froggy said to
himself. “I like to sing. I am going to sing
with the birds.”
He took a deep breath and began to sing.

CROAK!
The birds stopped singing. One bird said,
“That croak was too loud.”
“Okay,” Froggy said. “I’ll try again.”

The birds started singing again. Froggy
took a deep breath and sang along.

The birds stopped singing. “We are all
singing the same song,” the bird said. “And it
is a sweet one!”
“I know,” Froggy said. “I like sweet
songs.”
“Then sing very, very sweetly,” the bird
said. “And sing what we are singing.”

The birds started singing again. Froggy
opened his mouth. He closed it. He opened it
again, took a little breath, and began to sing.

Ribbit!
Tweet, tweet, tweet!

The birds flew away.

Froggy was sad. He didn’t sing. He didn’t
play with his friends. He just sat on his lily
pad all day, all by himself.
His friends missed him. Late that day,
they came to see him.

“Hey, Froggy,” Duck said. “What’s
the matter?”
“The birds don’t like my singing,”
Froggy said.
“They don’t like my singing either,”
Duck said. “I don’t know why.” She took
a deep breath and began to sing.
“I like that,” Froggy said.

Quack!

“They don’t like the sound of my drum
either,” Turtle said. “I don’t know why.” He
picked up two sticks. He drummed on a tree.
He drummed on a rock. He even drummed on
his own shell.
“I like that,” Froggy said.

Rat-a-tat-a-tat!

“They don’t like my playing either,” Otter
said. “I don’t know why.” Otter picked up his
guitar. He played a very loud song.

Froggy said, “I have an idea. We don’t
need to sing with the birds. We can sing with
each other! We can be a band!”

From then on, Froggy and his friends
played and sang a lot. Sometimes they played
sweet songs, but most of the time, they sang
very, very LOUD songs.
And everyone loved their band.




=====================================================
93 Good Friends

Poor Duck! She had a broken wing.
“Don’t be sad, Duck,” said Froggy. “The
doctor said your wing will get better soon.”
“I know,” Duck said. But she still looked
unhappy.
“What’s the matter? Does your wing
hurt?” Froggy asked.

“No,” Duck said. “I just miss flying.”
She stared up at the wide, blue sky.
“You’re a frog,” she said. “You wouldn’t
understand.”

After Duck went home, Froggy looked up
at the sky, too.
“Hmmm,” he said. “I wonder . . .”

The next morning, Froggy got busy.
He got a lot of balloons. He moved
a chair out to the edge of the pond.
Then he hopped over to Duck’s house.
“Come with me,” he said. “I have something
to show you.”
“What are you doing with all those
balloons?” Duck asked.
“You’ll see,” said Froggy.

By the pond, Duck saw a big chair
with balloons tied to it.
“Why is that chair here?”
she asked.

“You’ll see. Sit here,” Froggy said.
He was tying more balloons to the chair.
He hopped on the chair with Duck. He
tied on the last balloon. Then something
surprising happened.
The chair lifted off the ground.
It f loated up, up, up.

“There!” Froggy said. “How do you
like that? We’re flying!”
Duck smiled a big duck smile.
“Oh, Froggy!” she cried. “We are flying.
This feels wonderful! Thank you so much!”
“We’re friends!” Froggy said.
“And I am glad to help.”

“Flying is so exciting and so much
fun!” Duck said. “The sun is so warm. The
air is so cool. And just look! You can see
everything from up here!”

Froggy looked down, down, down.
Then he gulped and turned pale green.
“What’s the matter?” Duck asked.
“I just found out that I don’t like high
places,” Froggy whispered.

Then he cried, “Help! I’m going
to fall!”
“No, no,” Duck said. “Just look at the
pond down there! It’s so shiny and blue.
It’s beautiful!”

But Froggy would not look down again.
He squeezed his eyes shut.
“Oh, oh, oh,” he groaned. “What a
foolish frog I am! I got us up here. But I
don’t know how to get back down! And I
think I’m going to be sick!”

Duck peered down at the ground.
It looked fine to her, but for a frog, perhaps
it was far away.
“Hmmm,” she said. “I wonder . . .”
She looked around one last time at the sky
she loved so much. Then she shrugged and
got to work.

Duck untied the balloons and let them
float away, one at a time.
The chair sank lower and lower. At last
it gave a little bump.
“What was that?” Froggy asked.
“You can open your eyes now,” Duck
said. “We’re on the ground.”

“Oh, Duck!” Froggy cried. “How
wonderful! We are back on the ground.
Thank you, thank you, thank you!”

“We’re friends!” Duck said. “And I am
glad to help.”

94 Elephant and Tiger

Tiger and Elephant were best friends.
They loved the good things about
each other.
They did not let the bad things
bother them.
Elephant was very strong.
He liked to knock things down.
Tiger thought Elephant
should not knock things down.
But he did not let it bother him,
because Elephant was his best friend.

Tiger was very proud.
He liked to brag about himself.
Elephant thought Tiger
should not brag about himself.
But he did not let it bother him,
because Tiger was his best friend.
“Look at me!” bragged Tiger.
“I am the fastest animal here.”
Tiger ran across the grass
and back.
He ran very fast.

“How about that?” said Tiger.
Elephant did not say a word.
Tiger bragged, “I am the fastest
animal here.”
“You are fast,” said Elephant.

“Look at this!” bragged Tiger.
“I am the best jumper here.”
Tiger jumped across the stream
and back.
He jumped very far.

“How about that?” said Tiger.
Elephant did not say a word.
Tiger bragged, “I can jump
farther than any animal.
I am the best jumper here.”
“You are a good jumper,”
said Elephant.

“How about this?” said Tiger.
“I am the best climber here.”
Tiger climbed up a tall tree.
He hung down by his strong claws.
“How about that?” said Tiger.
“Am I the best climber here?”
Elephant laughed.
“You are a very funny tiger!”
he said.

Tiger opened his mouth wide
and showed his big teeth.
“I am very scary, too!”
he bragged.
“I am the scariest animal
in the jungle.”
Tiger roared.
He roared and roared.

Elephant did not say a word.
“How about that?”
said Tiger.
“Am I the scariest animal here?”
“You are scary,” said Elephant.

Tiger bragged,
“I am the fastest animal here.
I am the best jumper.
I am the best climber.
I am the scariest animal.”
He was so proud of himself
that he went off to show
all the other animals
what he could do best.
Elephant didn’t say a word.

Tiger was fast.
He could jump very far.
He could climb trees
and he could roar.
But he was not good
at looking where he was going.
Tiger fell into a deep hole.
He jumped as high as he could.
He could not get out.
“Help!” cried Tiger.
He was not bragging now.

Elephant heard Tiger
crying for help.
He ran as fast as he could.
He looked down at Tiger
in the hole.

Elephant knocked down
a tall tree.
He lifted it up and put
it in the hole.
Tiger was a good climber.
He climbed up the tree
and out of the hole.

“Thank you, Elephant,”
said Tiger.
“I am the fastest animal here.
I am the best jumper
and the best climber
and the scariest animal here.
But you are the best
at something, too.”
“What’s that?” said Elephant.
“You are the best friend
I have,” Tiger said.

095 Jack and the
Beanstalk

Once upon a time there was a poor boy
named Jack. He lived with his mother in a
small cottage far out in the country. A mean
giant lived in a castle high up in the clouds.
Jack and his mother were poor because the
giant had taken all their money.

One morning, Jack woke up and went
to the kitchen.
“Mother,” Jack cried, “we have nothing left
to eat! And we have no money. What should
we do?”
“You must sell our cow at the market,”
his mother said. “We can use the money
to buy some food.”

Jack went off to sell the cow. On the way,
he met an old man.
“Where are you going?” the man asked Jack.
“I am going to the market to sell my cow,”
said Jack. “A mean giant took our money.
We are poor and have nothing to eat.”

“I have some magic beans to show you,” said
the old man. “You give me your cow, and I’ll
give you the beans. They will grow overnight,
and you will have plenty to eat.”
“Thank you,” said Jack. He left the cow and
went home with the beans.

When Jack returned home, his mother was
waiting. “How much money did you get for
the cow?” she asked.

“Oh, Mother,” Jack cried, “I have something better
than money! I met an old man on the road to the
market. He gave me some magic beans, and I gave
him our cow.”

“Magic beans? What good are magic beans?”
yelled Jack’s mother. “What a fool you are,
Jack!” And she tossed the beans out the
window into the yard.
That night, Jack and his mother went to
bed hungry.

The next morning, Jack jumped out of bed.
He dressed quickly and ran to the window.
Jack couldn’t believe his eyes. A tall
beanstalk had grown way, way up into
the clouds.
“Mother, Mother!” Jack called. “Come quickly!
The magic beans have grown overnight.
Now we’ll have lots of beans to eat.”

Jack and his mother went outside. Jack
started to climb up the beanstalk.
“What are you doing, Jack?” cried his mother.
“Come down! You might fall.”
“I want to see what’s at the top,” said Jack.
“I’ll be back soon.” Jack climbed up, up, up
into the clouds.

At the top of the beanstalk, Jack saw
a long road.
“This is the road to the giant’s castle,”
thought Jack. “I want to see this castle.”
So Jack stepped off the beanstalk and
followed the road to the castle.

When Jack got to the castle, he opened the
door and peeked inside. He saw the giant
sitting at a table. The giant had a big sack
filled with gold coins. It was the money that
he had taken from Jack and his mother.

Clink, clank, clunk!
The giant was counting the coins one by one.

Before long, the giant fell asleep and began
to snore. Quickly, Jack grabbed the sack and
raced off with the money.

Clink, clank, clunk, went the coins,
waking up the giant.
“Come back here!” he yelled at Jack.
The giant turned red with anger.
Then he roared:
“Fee - fi - fo - fum.
I will squash you with my thumb!”

Jack dashed down the road as fast as lightning.
He started to climb down the beanstalk.
The giant roared like thunder.
“Fee - fi - fo - fum.
I will squash you with my thumb!”

Jack climbed down the beanstalk as fast as
he could. But the giant was not far behind.
He roared so loudly that the beanstalk shook.
“Fee - fi - fo - fum.
I will squash you with my thumb!”
Jack held tightly onto the beanstalk. When
he got to the bottom, he shouted, “Mother,
get the ax!”

With one blow of the ax, Jack cut down the
beanstalk. The beanstalk fell DOWN, DOWN,
DOWN, hitting the ground with a thud.
The giant was never heard from again.
And Jack and his mother
lived happily ever after.



=====================================================
96 Hide and Seek
“Come on, Moosling,” said Hoot.
“Play Hide and Seek with us.”
Moosling didn’t know how
to play. Beaver told him the rules.
“You hide, and I will look
for you,” Beaver said. “The last one
I find is the winner.”

“I am going to win!” said Moosling.
Moosling’s friends smiled. Moosling was very
big, and he had not played this game
before. He couldn’t win!

Beaver shut his eyes. He began to count.
The others went to hide.
One...Two...Three...

Mouse jumped into a hole.
“Ouch!” Mouse jumped back out.
“Sorry,” said Pins. “But I was
here first!”
Mouse looked for another place to hide.
Turtle saw some nice, round rocks by
the river. That gave him an idea.

Moosling ran here and there. He didn’t
know where to hide.
Could he hide behind a rock?
. . . or behind a tree?
. . . or in the pond?

Could he hide in the tall grass?
. . . or behind the hill?
He sat down to think.

Moosling began to get sleepy. He
always got sleepy when he had to think
too much. He didn’t see the snow begin
to pile up. He didn’t hear Beaver shout,
“Here I come!”

Beaver saw Hoot in a pine tree.
She was easy to find. She always forgot
to close her big, round eyes.
Then Beaver looked for Pins.
He found her.
“Ouch!” he cried.
“Sorry,” said Pins.

Beaver looked at the rocks by the river.
One of those rocks was Turtle’s shell! Turtle
must be hiding inside.
“Come out, Turtle!” shouted Beaver.
But Mouse jumped out!
“There was room for both of us,”
said Turtle.
“That was a good hiding place,”
Beaver said to Mouse.

“Did I win?” Mouse asked. “Am I
the last one you found?”
“No!” said Beaver. “I didn’t
find Moosling!”

Beaver looked for Moosling. He looked
here and there and up and down.
Hoot and Pins and Turtle looked. Little
Mouse wanted to look, too. But the snow
was very deep.

They could not find that moose!

Where
are
you?

“I give up!” said Beaver.
Then Pins said, “The snow is snoring.”
“What?” said Turtle.
Pins said, “This snow is snoring. Can’t
you hear it?” She was right. The animals
began to dig in the snow.

“Wake up, Moosling!” said Pins.
“Why?” said Moosling.
Beaver said, “You are the last one I
found. You won!”
“Yes! I knew I’d win!” said Moosling.

And he went back to sleep.

House Cat
This is a house cat. It has fur, claws,
and padded feet. A house cat lives with
a human family. House cats have soft fur.
They lick their fur to keep it clean.

Lion
This is a lion. It has fur, claws, and
padded feet. A lion lives outdoors with
its lion family.
Lions have soft fur that gets covered
with dirt and mud. But lions clean their fur
just like house cats do.

House Cat
House cats come in many sizes.
But all house cats are the right size
for people to hold in their arms.
People love to hold and pet their
house cats.

Lion
It would not be a good idea to pet
a lion! Lions are big and strong. A grown
lion weighs as much as three or four
people. Big lions need to be left alone.

House Cat
House cats do not have to hunt for
food. Their families give them food that
comes from a store. House cats eat the
food out of bowls.

Lion
Lions must hunt for their food. Hunting
is hard work. Sometimes lions have to
chase many animals before they can catch
one to eat.

House Cat
House cats love to sleep. They nap in
the day, and they nap at night. House
cats spend most of their time asleep!

Lion
Lions love to sleep, too. They can
sleep all day! There are 24 hours in a
day. Lions spend about 20 of those hours
sleeping or resting.

House Cat
When house cats are happy, they make
a soft, purring sound. When a cat purrs,
you can hear it. You can feel it with your
hands, too.

Lion
When lions are angry, they make a
loud, roaring sound. A lion roars to keep
danger away from its family. You can hear
a lion roar from five miles away!

House Cat
Baby house cats are called kittens.
Mother cats feed and take care of their
kittens. If a kitten gets too far away, the
mother cat goes after it. She picks up her
kitten with her mouth and brings it back
to the other kittens.

Lion
Baby lions are called cubs. Just like
house cats, mother lions feed and take
care of their cubs. If a cub gets too far
away, the mother lion goes after it. She
picks up her cub with her mouth and
brings it back to the other cubs.

House Cat
Kittens love to play. They jump and
chase each other. They pounce on things
that move. They love to play with
people, too.

Lion
Lion cubs love to play. They jump and
chase each other. They pounce on things
that move. When lion cubs play, it is not
just for fun. They are learning how to hunt
for food.

House cats are little cats. Lions are
big cats. House cats and lions are alike
in many ways. But only one kind of cat
makes a good pet!

99 A Surprise for
the Big Bad Wolf

Once upon a time there were three little
pigs. Pete lived in a straw house. Percy lived in
a stick house. Petunia lived in a brick house.
A Big Bad Wolf blew down the straw house
and the stick house. After that, all three pigs
lived together in Petunia’s brick house.

One day, Petunia went to visit her friend
Penny Pig.
“Goodbye, boys,” said Petunia. “Don’t let
any strangers in the house!”

“Our sister was so kind to let us live with
her,” said Pete. “How can we thank her?”
“Let’s surprise Petunia!” said Percy. “We
can make her favorite dinner.”
“But we don’t know how to cook!”
said Pete.
“How hard can it be?” asked Percy.

Percy looked in his sister’s cookbooks.
He found out how to make Petunia’s favorite
meal—vegetable stew and carrot cake. Pete
made a list of everything they needed to buy.

Then Percy and Pete went to the market.
“What are you going to do with all this
food?” asked the clerk.
“We’re going to make dinner for our
sister,” said Pete. “It’s a surprise!”

“Cooking is a hard job,” said the clerk.
“If you need help, you can always call Chef
Lobo. He’s the best cook in town! Here is
his telephone number.”

When they got home, Percy said, “Let’s
make the cake first.”
They mixed the batter. They put it in
the pan. They baked it in the oven. They put
the frosting on the cake.
“This cake is a mess!” said Percy.
“Maybe we should call Chef Lobo,”
said Pete.
So they did.

A few minutes later, the doorbell rang.
“Never fear, Chef Lobo is here!” cried the
chef. “I’ll cook you a feast fit for a wolf! I
mean, fit for a pig!”
Chef Lobo took out a huge pot and filled
it with water.
“That pot is too big for stew,” said Percy.
“I know what I’m doing,” said Chef Lobo.

While Chef Lobo worked in the kitchen,
Percy and Pete set the table. Everything
looked perfect when Petunia walked in.
“What’s all this?” asked Petunia.

“It’s a surprise for you!” said Pete.
“We’re having your favorite dinner,” said
Percy. “Vegetable stew!”
“Who’s cooking?” said Petunia.
“Chef Lobo,” said Percy. “He’s the best
cook in town.”
“Oh, really?” said Petunia. “Let me see.”

Petunia peered into the kitchen. Then she
carefully closed the door.
“That’s no chef!” she told her brothers.
“That’s the Big Bad Wolf! With that great big
pot, I think he’s planning to make Little
Pig Stew.”

“Oh, no!” said Pete and Percy. “What will
we do?”
“I have an idea,” said Petunia. “I’ll hide,
and you call the wolf in here.”

Petunia tiptoed into the kitchen. She went
to the stew pot and dumped in:
3 bottles of hot sauce,
2 jars of red pepper,
and
1 tin of black pepper.
Then she hid and waited.

The wolf came back. He dipped in a
spoon and tasted the stew.
YOW! That stew was hot! It was very,
very hot. It made his mouth burn. It made his
eyes water so much that he couldn’t see.
He couldn’t see Petunia open the
back door.

He couldn’t see
the three little pigs
push him outside.
He couldn’t see them
lock all the doors
and windows.
He couldn’t see them
sit down and enjoy
their messy, but delicious,
carrot cake!

100 The Ladybug
and the Cricket

Once there were two friends.
One was a ladybug.
The ladybug looked very beautiful.
The other was a cricket.
The cricket made beautiful music.

The two friends liked each other
very much.
Each friend had one thing
that the other wished for.

“You make the most wonderful music!”
said the ladybug to the cricket.
“I wish I could make beautiful music
like you do.”

It was true.
On warm summer evenings,
the cricket rubbed his wings together.
Out came a sweet chirpy sound.
The ladybug had wings,
but they made no music at all.

“You are so beautiful,”
said the cricket to the ladybug.
“I wish I looked as beautiful
as you do. You’re as lovely
as any flower!”

It was true. The ladybug’s body
was shiny and red,
with deep black dots.
It shone in the sun
like colored glass.
The cricket’s body was
a dull, plain, brown color.


The ladybug sighed
because her friend was sad.
She wished she could help him
have what he wished for.
The cricket sighed
because his friend was sad.
He wished he could help her have
what she wished for.
Suddenly, each of them
had an idea.

“I must run!
I’m late for dinner!”
cried the ladybug.
“Oh, my! It’s getting late!
See you tomorrow!”
cried the cricket.
The two friends rushed off.

That night, the ladybug
stayed up long after the sun
went to bed.
She lined up pots and jars and
brushes. She mixed flower dust
and dew.
Then she smiled a ladybug smile.

The cricket stayed up late, too.
He got some sticks and
a nut shell. He took apart
an old spider web.
Then he smiled a cricket smile.

The next morning, the ladybug
and the cricket met in the field.
“I have a surprise for you!”
said the ladybug.
She pulled out a coat
of red and black. It was
just the right size
for a cricket.
“I made you a shiny new coat!”

“I have a surprise for you, too!”
said the cricket.
He pulled out a tiny violin.
It was just the right size
for a ladybug.
“I will teach you how
to play music!”

The cricket had beautiful colors
like the ladybug.
The ladybug played beautiful
music like the cricket.
They each had
what they wished for.
And they had each other.




=====================================================
101 The
Costume Party

Mouse had cleaned her nest. She had
stored all the nuts she needed for winter.
She had washed her fur from the tips of
her ears to the tips of her toes.
Mouse wanted to do something fun.

“Let’s have a party,” she said.
“What kind of party?” asked Skunk.
“We can play games,” said Pins.
“We can have dancing,” said Rabbit.
“We can have food!” said Moosling.
He was always hungry.

“I know!” said Hoot. “We can have
a costume party!”
“What is a costume party?”
Moosling asked.
“It’s a dress-up party,” Hoot told him.
“You dress up as someone else. You can
even dress up as a thing! Mouse dressed
up as a carrot last time.”
“It will be fun!” Mouse said. “I can
choose the best costume. I’ll even give
a prize!”

“Can we still have dancing?”
asked Skunk.
“And games?” asked Rabbit.
“And food?” Moosling asked.
“Yes, yes, yes,” said Hoot. “And guess
what! I have a trunk full of old clothes and
other things. You can all come and get
what you want to use for costumes.”

So Hoot opened her big trunk, and all
the animals came to find things to wear.
They came one by one, because they all
wanted their costumes to be a surprise.

Mouse came to look in the trunk. Then
Pins came. Rabbit, Beaver, and Frog all got
costumes. Skunk got a costume, and so did
all the little skunks.

But when it was Moosling’s turn, he
had a problem.
Nothing fit him!
No pants would fit on his long legs.
No shoes would fit on his big feet.
And not one hat would fit on his big,
big head.
Every wig was far too small, and so
were all the funny glasses.

“Oh, dear,” said Moosling. “What can
I do, Hoot? Where can we find a costume
big enough to fit me?”
Hoot looked into the trunk. “Don’t
worry, Moosling,” she said. “I have an idea.”

All the animals came to the party.
They danced and played games.
“Is that you, Pins?” said a dentist.
“Yes!” said the clown. “Is that you,
Beaver?”
“Yes, it’s me!” said the dentist.
“All the costumes are great!
It will be hard for Mouse
to choose the best one.”

Rabbit was dressed up as a cowboy.
He hopped here and there, saying “Howdy!”
to everyone. Frog was dressed as a prince,
and Turtle’s shell was painted to look like
a race car. Mouse looked pretty dressed
up as a sunflower. Hoot looked very
pretty, too. The owl was sitting in a tree,
watching the fun.

Beaver and Pins didn’t know who was
in the dragon costume, so they peeked.
“I don’t see Moosling,” said Mouse.
“You’re right,” said Skunk. “Why isn’t
Moosling here?”
All the animals began to ask about
their moose friend.

“Where is Moosling?” asked Mouse.
“Why didn’t Moosling come to the
party?” Rabbit wanted to know.
“We want Moosling!” said the little
skunks.

“Here I am!” cried Moosling.
A grin appeared on the trunk of the
tree where Hoot was sitting. Then two big
eyes blinked.

“Moosling!” cried Mouse. “It’s you!”
“You were here all the time!” said Pins.
“We didn’t even see you in that tree
costume!” Rabbit said.
“Wow!” said the little skunks. “Can we
climb you?”

“Well,” said Mouse. “It is not hard
to choose the best costume after all!”
And she pinned a blue ribbon right on
the big brown tree.

102 Moosling
in Winter

	 Moosling saw leaves falling from
the trees. He saw snow falling from
the sky. He looked at the ice on the
pond. Winter was coming.

	 “Good-bye, Moosling,” said Duck.
“Where are you going?”
Moosling asked.	
“I’m going to a warm place,” said
Duck. “I fly there every winter.”
“So do I,” said Goose.
“So do I,” said Robin.
“We do, too,” said the other birds.

	 “But I’ll come back as soon as
winter is over,” said Duck.
“So will I,” said Goose.
“We will, too,” said the
other birds.	
Then they flapped their wings
and flew away.

	 The birds were gone. It was
quiet in the woods. It was too quiet.	
Moosling went to look for his friends.
“Hello, Frog!” said Moosling.
“Hello, Moosling,” said Frog.
“And good-bye.”
“What?” said Moosling. “Are you
flying away, like the birds?”
“I can’t fly. I dig down into the
mud,” said Frog. “I’ll sleep there all
winter long.”

	 Then Frog dug down deep into
the mud, and she was gone.
First the birds went away, and
now Frog was gone. Moosling was
beginning to feel sad.

	 But along came Skunk.
“Hello, Skunk!” shouted Moosling.
“Hi, Moosling,” said Skunk. “I
came to say good-bye.”
“Oh, no! Are you going away,
too?” Moosling asked. “Will you fly
away like the birds? Or will you
sleep in the mud like Frog?”

	 “I don’t fly. And mud is not for
me,” said Skunk. “I have a nice	
little den under a log. I’ll sleep
there until it’s warm again.”
Then off he went to his den.

	 Moosling went to look for his
other friends. Raccoon was asleep in
a hollow log. Squirrel and her family
were asleep in a tree.
It made Moosling think. Did
everyone fly away or go to sleep
in winter? It looked like they did.
Moosling could not fly. So . . .

. . . he got some of his favorite
things. He took them to a nice
warm spot.

	 Moosling tried to sleep. He
couldn’t. He turned over, and he
squeezed his eyes shut.
Then he turned over the other
way. He tried and he tried to go
to sleep.

	 “What’s going on, Moosling?”
said Rabbit. “It’s daytime. Why are
you in bed?”

	 “It’s winter,” said Moosling. “The
birds are gone, and my other friends
are sleeping. I can not fly away, so	
I am trying to go to sleep.”
“Don’t go to sleep,” said Rabbit.
“Come on. I have something to
show you.”

	 “Look!” said Rabbit. “Some of us
have fun in winter.”	
“Hurray!” shouted Moosling.
And he ran for the pond.




=====================================================
103 The
Roadrunners

Building a Nest
It is a spring day in the desert. A bird
is collecting sticks behind an old house
on Cactus Road. She uses the sticks to
make a nest.
The bird is Mother Roadrunner. Her
name tells you that she likes to run.
She doesn’t fly well, so she doesn’t
make her nest high in a tree. She
tucks the nest in some cactus plants.

Eggs in the Nest
Mother Roadrunner lays four eggs in
the nest over the next four days. Then
she settles down to sleep. She is tired
after all her hard work.
Later, the sound of rain wakes Mother
Roadrunner. She leaves her nest and
runs into the desert to sip rainwater.
Mother Roadrunner always runs
wherever she goes!
Father Roadrunner stays in the nest
while she is gone. He protects the eggs
until Mother Roadrunner comes back.

Mother Roadrunner sees some lizards
near a rain puddle. Lizards are fast.
But Mother Roadrunner is faster! She
zooms across the ground. She catches
a lizard. It is a good snack for a
roadrunner.

Guarding the Nest
Mother and Father Roadrunner take
turns guarding the nest for 14 days.
Mother Roadrunner stays in the nest
during the day. She goes out to
hunt for food at night. Then Father
Roadrunner watches the nest.
When 14 days have passed, both
Mother and Father Roadrunner stay
close to the nest.
Mother Roadrunner does make one
quick trip to get some spiders. But
she runs right back!

Soon, one of the eggs moves a little.
The baby roadrunner is inside the egg.
It is tapping at the shell. The baby
works hard. The baby uses its beak to
poke and peck at the egg. It takes
a long time to crack the egg’s shell.

Baby Roadrunners
One by one, the baby roadrunners
hatch out of the eggs.
The babies are hungry. They cheep
and peep. Mother Roadrunner feeds
her babies. Then the babies fall asleep.
The roadrunner babies can not run yet.
They can not even walk.

The roadrunner babies will be ready
to get their own food soon. They will
run fast. They will need less help from
Mother and Father Roadrunner.
But now, Mother and Father Roadrunner
protect the babies. Mother and Father
bring the babies food. They keep the
babies safe and warm in their nest near
Cactus Road.

Roadrunner Facts
• Roadrunners live in the desert. They
like to run along the road. That’s how
they got their name.
• Roadrunners are speedy birds. They
can run as fast as 15 miles per hour.
• Roadrunners’ feet are very strong.
Each foot has two toes in front and
two toes in back. It makes a footprint
that looks like an X.

104 March to
the Park

The ants were getting ready to work.
It was a fine day to go to work in the park.

“Don’t forget!” said Dexter, the leader
ant. “We are a team. We work together, and
we will share all the food we find!”
All the ants nodded their heads.
All but one. His name was Rudy, and
he had a plan.

The ants marched to the park. They
looked around and smiled. All over the park,
they saw people having picnics. There were
sandwiches, cookies, and chips laid out on
paper plates.

“This way!” said Dexter, and all the ants
turned left.
All but one. Rudy wanted to be a star.
He wanted to show Dexter that he was the
strongest and smartest ant on the team.
So Rudy turned right.

The ants marched up to one blanket.
“Oh, wow!” said Dexter. “We will carry a
feast of crumbs back home.”

Dexter told the team what to do. The
ants picked up sandwich crumbs, and cookie
crumbs, and chip crumbs. All the ants picked
up crumbs.
All but one ant.

Rudy was all alone, staring up at a big,
fat slice of cake. To the little ant, the cake
was as big as a mountain! Rudy looked back
at the other ants. They were all busy, helping
to pick up crumbs.

“I will be a star,” thought Rudy. “I will
carry home this big, fat slice of cake all
by myself.”
Rudy tried to lift one side of the cake,
but it would not move. He tried to lift the
other side, but it would not move. Then he
had an idea.

“If I eat a bit of cake, I can get under
it. Then I can lift the cake on my back,”
thought Rudy. “Yes, that will work!”
So Rudy ate a bit of cake. Then he got
under it. He tried to lift the big, fat slice of
cake. He lifted it a little. Then he lifted it
some more.

The cake went UP . . . UP . . . UP . . .
and then it came DOWN—right on top
of Rudy.
“Help! Help!” he cried. “I’m stuck under
the cake!” He waved his back legs, hoping
someone would see him.

Dexter heard Rudy’s cry.
“Come on,” Dexter shouted. He led the
whole team to help Rudy. Eight ants lifted
one side of the cake. Eight ants lifted the
other side of the cake. UP . . . UP . . . UP
. . . and Rudy was free!

Rudy wiped the frosting from his face.
“Thank you,” he said. “I’m so glad that I am
part of this team!”
“It looks like there is plenty of food to
share,” Dexter said with a grin. “Let’s eat!”





=====================================================
105 Venus
The Flytrap Who
Wouldn’t Eat Flies

Mason was having a terrible time
with his new Venus flytrap.
Flytraps are plants that eat bugs.
Well, they’re supposed to eat bugs.
“Venus is a little different,”
Mason told Mom.
“Why do you say that?” asked Mom.
“She never catches the f lies
buzzing around the window.”

Venus was a pretty, bright green f lytrap.
Her wide red jaws
were lined with soft little hairs.
Her jaws were filled
with sweet, sticky nectar.
Flies buzzed around Venus
trying to get the nectar.

“When a f ly touches those hairs—snap!”
Mason said.
“Her jaws are supposed to trap flies
inside. That’s what f lytraps do.
They eat f lies!”

Mason looked hard at Venus.
Something about her really was different.
Then Venus cried, “Ew!
That’s awful! I wouldn’t eat a f ly!”
Mason swallowed hard.
Was Venus really talking?
“What about a crunchy cricket?”
Mason asked.
He pointed at one outside the window.
“Uh-uh!” said Venus, shaking her head.

“How about a buzzy bee?” asked Mason.
He showed her one as it f lew
past the window.
“Uh-uh!” said Venus.
She snapped her jaws shut.
“A wiggly spider?” Mason asked.
He wiggled his fingers.
“No!” cried Venus, covering her eyes.

“Mom, I don’t understand why Venus
doesn’t eat f lies,” said Mason.
“Flytraps aren’t like other plants.
Flytraps can’t make their own food.
They must eat meat to live.”
“You mean bugs, right?”
asked Mom.

When she heard the word “bugs,”
Venus shook.
She sank down in her pot.
“Yes,” said Mason.
“She’s supposed to gobble up
f lies and wasps and beetles.”
“Ew, ew, ew!” said Venus,
as she covered her ears.

“Let’s give her time, Mason,”
said Mom.
“She’s still getting used to
living in a new place.
Venus will eat, sooner or later.”
But Venus did not eat.
Her bright green jaws turned
pale yellow.
Her stem bent way over.

“Oh, dear,” Mom sighed.
“Poor Venus isn’t doing well.”
“What should we do, Mom?”
asked Mason.
“Let’s take her to Papa Longo,”
Mom said.
“He grows beautiful plants.
If he can’t help her, no one can.”

They put Venus in a little basket
and hurried to Papa Longo’s Pizza Pies.
“Hello, hello,” Papa Longo said.
“What have you got there, Mason?”
Mason held up his sick plant.
“It’s Venus, my f lytrap,” he said.
“Papa Longo, she just won’t eat.”

“Won’t eat?” asked Papa Longo.
“She doesn’t like f lies,” said Mom.
“Who does?” Papa Longo laughed.
“She’s supposed to eat bugs,”
Mason said.
“Well, leave her with me,”
said Papa Longo.
“I’ll put her in a bright, sunny place.
I’ll try to get her to eat
a nice bug or two.”
Papa Longo put Venus
near a sunny, open window.
Flies buzzed at the screen.
The smell of pizza filled the air.

“Mmm,” said Venus, as she stood up
a bit. “What smells so good?”
“My best dish—pizza!”
said Papa Longo.

Papa Longo took a fresh pizza pie
from the oven.
“Mmm,” said Venus.
“It smells delicious. It looks delicious.”
“It is delicious, I promise you,”
said Papa Longo.
Venus hung over the pizza.
It smelled so good!

Just then, a f ly squeezed
through a hole in the screen.
It landed right on the pizza!
“No, no!” Papa Longo cried.
“It’s stuck in the cheese.
I can’t serve my customers a f ly pizza!”
“Papa Longo . . . ” Venus began.
“Yes, Venus?” he asked.
“May I have a slice?”


“Now the flytrap wants to eat a f ly!”
said Papa Longo.
He cut a little piece of pizza
and held it out to Venus.
Venus opened her mouth wide.
Snap! Venus snapped her jaws shut.
“Yum!” she cried.





=====================================================
106 Pen Pals
Miss Shay asked, “Who knows
what a pen pal is?”
A few kids raised their hands.
“A pen pal is someone you
write letters to,” said Luke.
“A pen pal is someone you
don’t know,” added Nell.

“You’re both right,” said Miss Shay.
“Each of you will get a pen pal from
another school. Your pen pal will write you
a letter. Then you will write back.”
The class buzzed with excitement.
Katie hoped her pen pal would be a girl.

One day, Katie’s mom came in
with the mail.
“Here’s a letter for you, Katie,” said
her mom.
Katie jumped up. “It’s from my
pen pal!” said Katie.
Katie ripped open the envelope
and read the letter.

March 8
Dear Katie,
	 Hi ! I’m your pen pal. I am
in the third grade at the Adams
School.
	 I have two brothers and a cat
named Fluffy.
	 Do you have any brothers
or sisters?
	 Do you have any pets?
	 What do you like to do for fun?
	 Write back soon!
Your pen pal,
Serena Perez

“My pen pal is a girl! And she
sounds nice,” said Katie. “Now it’s my
turn to write to her.”
“OK,” said Katie’s mom. “You can mail
your letter on the way to school tomorrow.”

March 11
Dear Serena,
	 I got your letter today. I am in
the third grade at the Harris School.
I’m so glad that we are pen pals!
I have a six-year-old sister. We share
a room.
	 I wish I could have a pet, but
dogs and cats make me sneeze!
	 I like to write stories, and I just
love sports. I am going to join a
soccer team.
	 Write back soon!
Your pen pal,	
Katie Reed

On her way to school the next day,
Katie dropped her letter in a mailbox. At
school, she signed up for the soccer team.
Miss Shay walked by and saw Katie
signing up.

“Good for you, Katie!” she said.
“Did you know I am coaching the team?”
“That’s great!” said Katie.
“In a few weeks, we will have
our first game against the Adams School,”
said Miss Shay.
Katie was excited. Serena went to the
Adams School. Maybe she would be in the
crowd cheering her school on!

When class began, Miss Shay asked the
students to tell about their pen pals.
Katie said, “My pen pal is named
Serena. She goes to the Adams School!”
“My pen pal is named Chris,” said Luke.
“But I don’t know if Chris is a boy
or a girl!”
Everyone laughed.

Then Miss Shay said, “That gives me
an idea! I’ll take photos of you to send
to your pen pals. Then maybe your pen pals
can send photos to you.”

The next time she wrote to Serena,
Katie clipped her picture to the letter.
She wrote, “I can’t wait to see what you
look like.”

Katie waited for a letter from Serena.
Finally, the letter came.
Katie opened the envelope quickly.
When she saw the picture of her pen pal,
she began to laugh out loud.

“What’s so funny?” asked Katie’s mom.
Katie said, “Well, Miss Shay said a
pen pal is someone you don’t know,
but I’m going to get to know Serena soon!”

Katie held up the picture of Serena.

107 The Fox
and the
Gulls

Long ago, Fox lived in a little reed hut
on the shore of a large lake. Early one
spring morning, the sound of splashing
water startled Fox.
“The gulls are back!” Fox cried. “It’s been
a long winter.” His stomach rumbled at the
thought of a tasty gull breakfast. “I just need
to wait a bit longer,” Fox said to himself.
“Soon I will have a tasty feast!”

From a distance, Fox watched Mother Gull
build a nest of twigs and reeds. When she
finished, Mother Gull laid her eggs.

Some weeks later, Fox heard the cries of
newborn gull chicks.
“Those gulls will be delicious,” Fox said to
himself. “I just need to wait a bit longer.
Soon I will have a tasty feast!”

One day, Mother Gull flew off to find food
for her chicks. Fox ran to the nest and
scooped up the baby gulls. He put the chicks
in an old sack. Then Fox ran back
to his little reed hut.

Fox was very tired by the time he got home.
“I’m too tired to cook,” he said. “I need
to rest before I fix dinner.” He dropped
the sack of chicks beside the pile of wood
outside his doorway. He went inside his hut
to take a nap.
While Fox slept, the baby chicks cried
for help.

Mother Gull heard her babies’ cries. She flew
as fast as she could to Fox’s hut.
“Shhh!” Mother Gull whispered. “Don’t cry,
my little ones.”
Mother Gull took the baby chicks out of the
sack. She carried them one by one to an
island in the middle of the lake. Fox could
not reach them there!

When all the chicks were safely on the island,
Mother Gull flew back to Fox’s hut.
“I will teach that mean Fox a lesson,” she said.
She filled the sack with thorny branches.

Fox woke up. He was very hungry. He went
outside and opened the sack. But when Fox
reached down to grab a chick, he got a paw
full of thorns instead!
“Ouch!” he cried. “Where is my tasty treat?”
Fox looked toward the lake. There were
Mother Gull and her chicks, watching him
from the island.
“Mother Gull has tricked me!” Fox cried.
“I must teach her a lesson.”

Fox could not swim across to the island to
steal the baby chicks again. So he came up
with a clever idea.
“I’ll drink the lake dry!” he said, smiling to
himself. “Then I can walk to the island.”
Fox drank and drank. He drank all day.
He drank all night. But the lake stayed full
of water!

The next morning, Mother Gull and her
chicks woke up on the island. They looked
back at the shore and saw Fox. He was so
full of water that he looked like a balloon!

And just like a balloon, Fox lifted up into
the air and f loated away. Mother Gull and
her baby chicks never had to worry about
Fox again.

108 Puddle Play

“Can we play outside?” asked Roxy.
Mother looked out the window.
“Yes,” she said. “Just don’t get muddy.
It rained last night.”
Roxy and Andy ran outside.

The sun was hot and the grass was dry.
But there was a big, muddy puddle in the
middle of the yard. Roxy ran right up to
the puddle.
“Mother said not to get muddy!”
said Andy.
“I’m not!” said Roxy.

But it was so hot, and the water looked
so cool! Roxy put her toes into the puddle.
“Mother will get angry,” said Andy.
“I’m just putting my toes in,” said Roxy.

Roxy stepped into the puddle with all
four feet. She wiggled her toes. Thick mud
squished between them.
Andy wiggled his toes in the dry grass.
But they just felt hot.

Roxy splashed some water on her legs.
“This water feels so good!” she said.
Andy watched the water run down Roxy’s
thick fur. He felt very, very hot.

Roxy stomped her feet. Then she yelled,
“Watch me dance!” She jumped and twirled
and splashed. She yipped and giggled and
laughed. Mud flew all around.

“I can’t stand it! I’m coming in!”
called Andy.
He ran as fast as he could and made the
biggest splash of all.
Soon Roxy and Andy were brown, muddy
messes! They were having so much fun, they
forgot all about what Mother had said.

But Mother didn’t forget.
“Roxy? Andy?” she called.

Mother marched up to them. She did
not look happy. “What did I tell you about
getting muddy?” she said.
“Oh, no!” said Roxy. She dashed out of
the puddle. “We forgot!”
“We’re sorry!” said Andy, running just
as fast.

“I see,” said Mother. She looked down at
her little foxes. “What messes you are! Well,
you can’t go inside with all that mud. Let’s sit
down and wait for it to dry.”

Mother sat down in the grass. Roxy and
Andy sat beside her.
“Oh, my, it is hot out here,” said Mother.
She looked at the puddle. “You know, when
I was a little fox, I liked puddles, too,” she
said.
“You did?” asked Roxy.

“Yes, I did. And I loved putting my toes
in the mud,” said Mother.
“Really?” asked Andy.
“What other things did you like?”
asked Roxy.

“I liked playing in puddles,” said Mother
with a wink.
“I knew you were going to say that!”
said Andy.
He flicked a bit of mud at his mother.
Then he looked a little worried. But Mother
smiled and flicked the mud back at Andy.

Roxy ran to the puddle. “You can’t catch
me!” she called.
“Yes, I can!” said Mother.
Mother and Andy ran to catch Roxy.

And they all played in the mud until
the sun went down.

109 A Dragon’s Lullaby

In a castle high on a mountain lived a
kindly dragon called Dario. The dragon looked
after the people who lived in the village below.
Each evening, Dario stretched his golden wings
and flew over the village. When the sky grew
dark, Dario began to sing his lullabies.
“Now that day has turned to night,
and all the stars look so bright,
climb into bed and close your eyes,
and I will sing some lullabies.”

When Dario began to sing, the children
ran to their windows. They stood on tiptoes
and looked for Dario in the sky. Dario was
easy to see. His long, golden wings sparkled in
the moonlight.
Dario’s lullabies made the children so sleepy
that they crawled into bed and closed their
eyes. The dragon’s lullabies soon put everyone
in the village to sleep. The village was so still
you could hear a star shoot across the sky.

After singing his lullabies, Dario said,
“Good night, everyone. Sleep tight.” But no
one ever answered. All the villagers were
fast asleep.

One night, Dario did not appear in the
night sky. The dragon’s soothing lullabies were
not heard in the village.
Without the lullabies, the villagers couldn’t
fall asleep. The next day, the children were
cranky. The villagers got very little work done.
Everyone was tired.

A week passed. Dario still did not sing
his lullabies. The villagers were miserable.
They couldn’t sleep. They couldn’t work.
They were even too tired to eat! Something
had to be done.

At last, the mayor spoke up. “I’ll go see
Dario,” she said. “I’ll ask him why he has
stopped singing to us.”
The mayor climbed and climbed until she
reached Dario’s castle on top of the mountain.
It was daytime, but the mayor found Dario
in bed.
“What’s wrong, Dario?” the mayor asked.
“Are you sick? Is that why you don’t sing to
us anymore?”

Dario looked sadly at the mayor. “I will
tell you why I stopped singing,” he said.
“Every night I sing lullabies to the villagers.
Then I wish them good night. But no one
ever wishes me good night. The villagers don’t
care about me.” Then Dario cried and hid
under the covers.
“Oh, no, Dario!” the mayor answered.
“That’s not true!”
But Dario wasn’t listening.

The mayor went back down the mountain.
She called a meeting and told all the villagers
what Dario had said.
“Dario thinks we don’t care about him!”
she said. “How can we show him that we
do care?”
“I know!” said a small voice at the back
of the room. “We can sing Dario a lullaby!”

The people turned around to see who had
spoken. It was a little girl named Olivia.
“When Dario sings us a lullaby, we know
that he loves us,” Olivia said. “If we sing to
him, he’ll know that we love him, too!”

Everyone agreed. They decided to write a
special lullaby for the dragon. All the villagers
helped write the lullaby. Then they sent a card
to Dario. The next day, Dario got this card in
the mail:

Dario didn’t know what to think. But on
Wednesday night, he f lew down the mountain
and into the village. The mayor’s house was
dark when Dario arrived. A sign on the front
door said “Please Come In.”

Dario slowly opened the door. Suddenly,
the lights came on. The villagers shouted,
“We love you, Dario!”
Then they sang their lullaby:
“When the night has turned to day,
we can run and laugh and play.
But when it’s time to close our eyes,
we need your soothing lullabies.”

Dario’s heart filled with joy. He wanted to
thank the villagers for their kindness, but he
fell asleep!

The next night, Dario returned to the sky
with his songs. When he said, “Good night,”
no one answered. But this time Dario knew
why. His lullabies had put all the villagers
to sleep!

100 The Scream

	 Lizzy’s grandma was making soup. Lizzy
and Kim were watching. Grandma’s cat Babs
was watching, too.
	 “We have to go to see the doctor
tomorrow,” Grandma told Lizzy. “It’s time for
your check-up and your shot.”

	 “I don’t need to get a shot,” Lizzy
said. “I’m not sick!”
	 “Lizzy, every little girl needs her shots.
You know that,” said Grandma.
	 “I know that it will hurt!” said Lizzy.
	 
	 	 “A shot is not so bad,” Kim said. “I just
close my eyes and say ‘snake spit’ three times.”
	 “No shots!” said Lizzy.
	 “I can cheer you up,” Kim said. She put a
carrot top on her head like a hat. “Look!”
she said.
	 Lizzy and Grandma looked.
	 
	 	 Lizzy turned around. “Watch out!” she
said. “Babs is going to jump on the counter.”
	 Then Grandma screamed! It was a loud
scream. It was a scream that rattled the pots
and pans.
	 That cat got out of there, fast!
	 “Grandma! What is it?” Lizzy asked.
	 
	 “That’s how I keep that cat off my clean
counter,” Grandma said. “She hates loud
noises. Besides, I enjoy a good scream now
and then.”
	 “I think she scratched you,” Kim said. She
pointed at Grandma’s arm.
	 Grandma looked down at her arm. “I
guess she did. But she didn’t mean to scratch
me. And it’s just a tiny scratch.”

	 The girls got a bandage for Grandma’s arm.
	 “Does it hurt?” Lizzy asked.
	 “Not a bit,” said Grandma. She smiled at
them. “I was screaming so hard, I didn’t feel
a thing!”

	 “That was a very good scream, Mrs.
Tubbs,” said Kim.
	 Grandma smiled. “Well,” she said, “we are
all good screamers in our family. You should
hear Lizzy. She is as loud as a train whistle!”

	 Lizzy leaned on her grandma’s arm.
“I love you, Grandma,” she said.
	 “And I love you, kiddo,” said Grandma.
“But I have to take you to the doctor!”
	 Lizzy thought about it.
	 “Okay,” she said. “I’ll go. But I won’t
like it!”

	 The next day, Grandma took Lizzy
to see the doctor. Dr. Reed looked in Lizzy’s
ears. He listened to her heart, and he
thumped her on the back.
	 “You’re in good shape!” he said.
“You just need a little shot.”

	 “I don’t want a shot,” said Lizzy.
She wanted to run and hide.
	 “Don’t worry,” said Dr. Reed.
“You’ll just feel a little pinch.”

	 The doctor cleaned Lizzy’s skin with
a cold little wipe. Then he picked up
a needle.
	 Lizzy saw the tip of the needle near
her arm. She closed her eyes.

	 And she screamed!
It was a big, loud scream. It frightened
the nurse, and it rattled the windows. It was
a scream as loud as a train whistle!

	 “Lizzy! Lizzy!” said Dr. Reed. “Stop
screaming. It’s over. We are all done here.”
	 Lizzy opened her eyes.
	 “Really?” she asked. “We’re done?” But
Dr. Reed had turned away. He was rubbing
his ears.
	 “Lizzy, are you all right?” Grandma asked.

	 “I’m fine, Grandma!” Lizzy said.
“I screamed so hard, I didn’t feel a thing!”

	 
=====================================================
111 The Hot Day

It was a hot summer day.
Papa had a stack of papers in
front of him. “It’s hot enough to fry
an egg on the sidewalk!” he said.
“Really?” Jesse asked.
“People just say that when it’s
really hot,” Sam explained.

“You boys keep yourselves busy
while I finish this work,” Papa said.
“Then we’ll do something fun together
to cool off.”
It was too hot to ride bikes.
It was too hot to climb trees. Sam sat
on the f loor of Papa’s office and looked
at baseball cards.
But Jesse left.

He came back a few minutes later.
“Actually,” said Jesse, “it isn’t.”
“What isn’t?” Sam asked.
“It isn’t hot enough to fry an egg
on the sidewalk,” Jesse said.
Papa looked up from his work.
“Did you try to do that?” he asked.
“Yes, but the egg just sat there.
It didn’t cook. It didn’t even turn
white around the edges,” Jesse said.

Papa looked at his stack of papers.
“I need to work just a little longer,
boys, and I’ll be done.”
“Show me the egg, Jesse,”
Sam said.
As Sam and Jesse started to leave,
Papa asked, “Are there any eggs left?”
“Two,” said Jesse.
“That should be enough,” Papa
said. “And Jesse, stay out of the
refrigerator, all right?”

The egg had not changed a bit.
It looked like a yellow eye surrounded
by goo.
“Can you think of a hotter place
than this sidewalk?” asked Jesse.
“We could try again.” Jesse held up
the last two eggs. “I had them in my
pocket,” he said.
“I think Papa wants those eggs,”
Sam said. “You should put them back.”
“I can’t put them back,” Jesse
said. “Papa said to stay out of the
refrigerator.”
“I’ll put them back, then,”
said Sam. “Come on.”

Sam went through the back door
into the kitchen and waited. Jesse took
a long time to get there. As soon as
Sam saw Jesse, he said, “What are
you doing?”
Jesse had the two eggs set on top
of his sneakers. He was taking tiny
steps. “Actually, I’m pretending that
I’m a penguin,” Jesse said. “Father
penguins carry eggs this way for
weeks and weeks. I don’t know how
they stand it!”

Sam grinned. “At least it’s cold
where they live.”
“I know,” Jesse said. “They live
in Antarctica. That place is covered
with ice.” He looked at the refrigerator.
Then he started shuffling toward it.
“Papa said to stay out of the
refrigerator,” Sam warned.
“Actually, I am staying out of
the refrigerator,” Jesse said. “I need
something in the freezer instead.”

Jesse opened the freezer door and
reached for the bin of ice cubes. He
tipped all the ice cubes out and made
a little nest around his feet.
“Ah,” Jesse said. “That feels cool.”

“Penguins are lucky,” Sam said.
“They don’t have to worry about hot
days.”
“Actually, I think penguins have a
lot to worry about,” Jesse said. “They
must worry about sea lions. Sea lions
eat penguins.”

“Well then,” Sam said, “I’m a sea
lion.” And he threw himself down
on the floor. He rolled toward Jesse,
moving like a sea lion.
Jesse laughed and shuffled away
as fast as he could.
Ice cubes scattered.
Sam roared like a sea lion.
Jesse tripped.
And splat went the eggs!

“Oops!” said Jesse. He giggled.
“Oops!” Sam said. He laughed.
Then he looked around and said, “We’d
better clean this up.”

They had just finished cleaning
when Papa came in.
“I’m all done now,” he said.
“Let’s . . .” Then he stopped. “Well,
boys, you washed the kitchen floor.
How nice of you! You certainly deserve
a treat after that.”

“Let’s make some homemade ice
cream,” Papa said. “That will help us
stay cool! Sam, you get the eggs. And
Jesse, will you please get that big bin
of ice cubes that’s in the freezer?”

Uh-oh!

=====================================================
112 Moosling the Hero
“Help! Help!” someone called.
Moosling ran to help.

A nest of baby birds had fallen into
the river. The frightened mother bird was
calling for help.

Moosling jumped into the river. He
swam as fast as he could. He swam under
the water, and he came up with the nest
and the baby birds on his head.

“Oh, Moosling, you are my hero!” said
the mother bird. “Thank you! Thank you!”
Other animals ran up to thank
Moosling. They called him a hero, too.

Then they tried to get the bird’s nest
off Moosling’s head. First, Beaver tugged at
it. Then Rabbit tugged even harder. That
didn’t work, so Beaver, Rabbit, and Skunk
all tugged at it together. But the nest was
stuck!
“My babies are too little to leave the
nest,” their mother said. “They will have to
stay there on Moosling’s head until they
can fly.”

So Moosling began to look after the
baby birds. He had to be very careful.
He didn’t run or jump. The babies could
fall out of the nest! He didn’t swim.
The babies could float away!

He was careful to keep the little
baby birds out of the cold rain and
the hot sun, too.

Moosling stayed very still and quiet
when the baby birds were napping. And
when he got sleepy, he had to sleep
standing up!
“Being a hero is hard work,” he
whispered to Mouse.
“I can see that,” Mouse whispered back.

Then at last, one morning, a baby
bird hopped up on the side of the nest.
She flapped and flapped, and then she flew
up into a tree.
“Good girl!” said her mother.
Another bird flapped and flew.
“Good boy!” said his mother.

Then the last little bird flapped
and flapped and flew away!
“Good bird!” cried Moosling.

As soon as the birds were gone,
Moosling called to his friends. Together,
they tugged and pushed and tugged some
more. At last, they got the nest off
his head.

Then Moosling ran and jumped. He had
a good, long swim. Then he shook
the water off, and he ran and jumped
some more.

“It is nice to be a hero,” Moosling said.
“But it is more fun just to be a moose.”

113 All About
Astronauts
Chapter 1
Walking on the Moon
	 Astronauts travel into space. The
astronauts work in teams to do special jobs in
space. The jobs are called missions.
One team of U.S. astronauts had a very
special mission to f ly from Earth to the moon.
In July of 1969, people all over the world
watched on TV as this team arrived at the
moon. Astronaut Neil Armstrong became the
first person to walk on the moon.

	 After that, other astronauts went on
missions to the moon. They collected samples of
moon rocks and moon dirt, and they brought
their collections back to Earth. Scientists studied
the samples. Many people went to look at the
moon rocks on display in museums.

Chapter 2
Becoming an Astronaut
	 It takes a lot of study and hard work to
become an astronaut. The men and women
who become astronauts must be excellent
students. In college, they study math and
science. They need to learn all about Earth,
other planets, and outer space.

Fun Fact
The word astronaut means
“sailor among the stars.”

Chapter 3
Astronaut Training
	 After college, astronauts go to special
classes to learn more about space f light. They
learn about rockets, the stars, and the planets.
They learn about their special missions, too. Neil
Armstrong and his team of astronauts studied
the moon before their special mission. They
learned about the rocks they might find there.
	 Some astronauts are pilots. They know how
to f ly airplanes. During their astronaut training,
they learn how to f ly a spacecraft. They use
special models to practice f lying the spacecraft.

	 During training, astronauts learn how
to wear a space suit. There is no air in space,
so the suit has air tanks to help an astronaut
breathe.
The space suit is very big and bulky.
An astronaut learns how to move in the
suit by going into a pool. Moving around
underwater feels like moving around in space.

These astronauts are training underwater Caption to come.
in a pool at the Johnson Space Center.

Chapter 4
On the Spacecraft
	 On Earth, a force called gravity pulls us
toward the ground. On the moon and out in
space, there is little or no gravity. When the
spacecraft flies into space, the things inside
f loat around unless they are tied down.	
The astronauts have to eat food from
special packages. The packages are tied to a
tray, so the food doesn’t float away.
	 Inside the spacecraft the astronauts
f loat, too, if they are not tied down. When
the astronauts want to sleep or exercise, they
wear a special strap, like a seat belt, that
holds them in place.

 Sometimes the astronauts need to do work
outside the spacecraft. They put on their space
suits and take a space walk.
Temperatures in space can be very hot
or very cold, so an astronaut wears special
underwear under the space suit. Small tubes run
through the underwear. Water is pumped through
the tubes to warm or cool the astronaut.

Chapter 5
Space Camp
	 Some kids dream of becoming an
astronaut. At Space Camp, kids can train
like astronauts do. They dress in space suits
and they learn about spacecraft. They even
learn how to eat and sleep in space.

 Kids at Space Camp learn how to walk
and move in space, where there is little or no
gravity. They use special chairs that can move
forward, backward, or even upside down! They
might even practice taking a space walk—but
not a real one!

	 On a spacecraft, each astronaut has a special
job to do. Astronauts have to work as a team to
complete their mission. At Space Camp, kids learn
the importance of teamwork, too. They take turns
being in charge of a mission. Someday these kids
may become real astronauts!

114 Too Many Teeth

Annie Alligator was worried.
“On Friday, Mom is taking me to
see the dentist,” thought Annie.
“I’ve never been to the dentist
before. What will Dr. Cobb do
to my teeth?”
Annie looked at her teeth in the
mirror. Then she started to count
them. She counted her top teeth.
She counted her bottom teeth.
There were dozens of teeth to count.

Annie worried and worried.
“I have so many teeth,” she thought.
“What if Dr. Cobb wants to take some of
them out?”

The next day at school, Annie
smiled at her friends. When they
smiled back, she counted their teeth.
She had more teeth
than Becky Beaver.
She had more teeth
than Ray Rabbit.
And she had
a lot more teeth
than Tara Turtle.

“Don’t forget,” Mom said on
Friday morning. “I will pick you
up after school, so you can visit
the dentist.”
“Oh, no!” Annie said to herself.
“The dentist will say I have too many
teeth. I have a lot more teeth than my
friends.”
Annie felt more and more worried.
She started to count her teeth again.

“Hop in the car,” said Annie’s
mom after school on Friday. “We don’t
want to be late.”
“Mom, I don’t want to go to the
dentist,” Annie complained.
“Don’t worry,” said her mom. “You
will like Dr. Cobb!”

At Dr. Cobb’s office, Annie sat
and waited with her mom. She looked
at pictures of teeth on the wall. There
were big teeth, and there were little
teeth. There were lots and lots
of teeth.

“Annie Alligator,” called
Dr. Cobb’s helper.
Annie tried to hide behind a
tall plant.
“It’s your turn, Annie,” said her
mom, peeking around the plant.
“That’s right, Annie,” said the
helper. “I’m Sandy. Please come with
me, and I promise we will take good
care of your teeth.”

Annie sat in a big chair and
worried. What would Sandy say when
she noticed that Annie had too
many teeth?
Sandy looked at Annie’s teeth
with a little mirror. Then she brushed
Annie’s teeth with a noisy toothbrush.
Finally, she flossed Annie’s teeth.

“Look in the mirror, Annie,”
Sandy said. “Your teeth are nice and
clean now. I’ll call Dr. Cobb to come
in and take a look.”

“Hello, Annie. I’m Dr. Cobb,” said
the dentist. “Can you open your mouth
for me so I can take a look?”
Dr. Cobb looked at Annie’s top
teeth. She looked at Annie’s bottom
teeth. She looked at the teeth that
were way, way in the back.

“Smile for me, Annie,” Dr. Cobb
said. “Your teeth look great!”
But Annie was not quite ready to
smile. She had a question to ask.
“Do I have too many teeth?”
Annie asked the dentist. “I have a lot
more teeth than my friends.”

Dr. Cobb gave Annie a wide
alligator smile. “You’re an alligator,
Annie,” said Dr. Cobb. “An alligator
can never have too many teeth!”

116 Libby’s
New Friend

Libby stretched her long neck.
Then she ate some leaves at the top
of a tree.
“Yum!” said Libby.

“Aren’t these leaves tasty?” asked
her sister Lucy. “I could eat them
all day!”
“I like them, too,” Libby said.
“These leaves are so soft and sweet.”

Just then, a giant ROAR shook
the forest.
“It’s T. Rex!” Lucy shouted. “Run!”
Libby turned and saw T. Rex
crashing through the trees and
showing his long, sharp teeth.

“Oh, no!” said Lucy. “T. Rex is
so loud and scary. Let’s get out
of here.”

Lucy ran and hid behind a tree.
But Libby didn’t want to run away.
She liked the forest. She wanted to
eat more of the soft, sweet leaves.

Libby turned and looked down
at T. Rex.
“Watch where you’re going!”
she shouted.
T. Rex looked around.
“Are you talking to me?”
he asked.
“Of course I’m talking to you,”
Libby answered. “You scared everyone
else away!”
“I know,” T. Rex said, and his
eyes filled with tears.
“What’s wrong?” Libby asked.

T. Rex said, “No one ever talks
to me. No one wants to play with
me. Everyone thinks I’m scary.”
He began to sob. Tears rolled
down his sad face.

“Don’t cry,” Libby said. “Some
dinosaurs want to be scary like you!
Isn’t it fun to be scary?”
“No, it is NOT fun to be scary,”
T. Rex said with a sniffle. “No one
wants to be my friend.”

Libby thought for a little while.
Then she had an idea.
“I know how you can be a little
less scary,” said Libby.
“Really? How?” asked T. Rex.
“Well,” said Libby, “you can
close your mouth so those scary
teeth don’t show.”

T. Rex closed his mouth
and smiled.
“Oh, that’s much better!” said
Libby. “You can try not to shake
the ground when you walk, too. And
does your roar have to be so loud?”

T. Rex roared quietly.
“Is that better?” he asked.
“Yes,” said Libby, and
she smiled.
Just then, they heard a
very loud roar in the forest.
“That’s my mom calling me for
dinner,” said T. Rex. “I ’d better go.”
“OK,” said Libby. “Do you want
to play with me tomorrow?”
“YES!” said T. Rex. Then he
waved good-bye and tiptoed off into
the forest.
“See you tomorrow!” called Libby.

Lucy came up behind Libby.
“Good work, Libby,” said Lucy.
“You made a new friend!”

118 The Pirates
One spring morning, Jesse said, “Let’s
play pirates.” He had a bandana around his
head, and he was holding his telescope.
“I don’t want to play pirates,” Sam said.
“But I’d like to find some pirate gold.”

“We can dig for gold,” Jesse said. “Where
should we dig? And what do you think
we’ll find?”
“We’ll find dirt,” Sam said. “And maybe
we’ll find worms.” He smiled. “But then we
could go fishing.”

Papa heard them talking. He said, “You
know, boys, there were pirates around here,
long ago.”
“Really?” Jesse asked.
“Yes,” Papa said. “And the pirates did
bury gold. Maybe the gold is right in
this yard.”

Sam wasn’t sure about that. “Someone
must have found that gold long ago,”
he said.
“You never know,” Papa said. “I may have
an old pirate map somewhere around here.
Why don’t you get some digging tools? I’ll
look for that map.”

So Sam and Jesse got shovels out of
the tool shed. Papa met them on the lawn.
He had a rolled-up sheet of brown paper in
his hand.

“I found it!” Papa said. He unrolled the
paper. It was a map. The map showed the
house and the front walk. It had a big X on
each side of the walk.
“Hurray!” Jesse cheered. “A real pirate’s
map! And it has two Xs, one for each of us.
Let’s start digging.”

Papa helped them get started. Then he
went back into the house. As soon as Papa
left, Sam shook his head. “This map is not
very old,” he said. “It has the house and the
front walk on it.”

“I know,” said Jesse. “And I saw a blank
sheet of paper just like this on Papa’s desk.
But maybe Papa buried something for us, just
so we can dig it up.”
“Maybe,” Sam said. He picked a worm
out of the dirt and put it in a can. “At least
we can use the worms to go fishing.”

Sam and Jesse dug and dug. Soon they
had two deep holes, and Sam had a can
full of worms.
Papa came back. He was pushing a
wheelbarrow. “Nice digging, boys,” he said.
“But we didn’t find any gold,” Jesse said.

“That’s too bad,” Papa said. “But you
dug two fine holes. If we dig a little more,
those holes will be just right for these cherry
trees.”
“Papa! You fooled us!” Jesse said.
“You had us dig these holes for your
trees,” Sam said.

“Don’t you think cherries are as good as
gold?” Papa asked. “They taste a lot better
than gold.”
“I don’t see any cherries on those trees,”
Sam said.
Papa said, “It won’t be long before
you can climb these trees and pick all the
cherries you want.”
“How long?” Jesse asked.
Papa thought for a bit. “Oh, maybe five
or six years.”

“That’s too long to wait!” Sam said. “And
we had to dig a lot.” He looked at Jesse. “I
think I do want to play pirates!” he said.
Jesse nodded. “Yo ho ho!” he said.
Sam said, “Let’s make Papa walk
the plank!”

Papa reached into the wheelbarrow
and picked up a bowl.
“Well, boys, I do have some cherries we
can eat now,” he said. “And I made a cherry
pie for dessert tonight. Will that save me
from walking the plank?”

“These cherries are good,” Jesse said.
“Does Papa still have to walk the plank, Sam?”
“Maybe not,” Sam said. He picked up his
can of worms. “I won’t make him walk the
plank if he takes us fishing.”

So Papa did not have to walk the plank.
And they all had a tasty supper of fresh fish
and cherry pie.

119 The Pirates
Chapter 1: Cold Ears
This is the story of Chester Greenwood
and his big idea. Chester lived a long time
ago in a small town in Maine. The winters
were very cold there.

Chester Greenwood had big ears. His ears
got very, very cold in the winter. Chester
tried many things. He just couldn’t keep his
ears warm.

Chester got a very special present the day
he turned fifteen: ice skates! They were just
what he wanted.
It was very cold outside, and the pond
was frozen solid. It was a good day to try out
those new skates.

Soon Chester was skating with his friends.
Then it got colder, and the wind began to
blow.
Chester’s ears felt like ice cubes. He was
just too cold to keep skating. He gave up and
went home.

Chapter 2: Chester’s Plan
Chester loved his new skates. But when
he skated, the cold wind whistled past his ears.
His ears got so cold that they hurt!
Chester needed to find a way to keep his
ears warm. The next day, he wrapped his scarf
around and around his head. Then he walked
to the pond.

Chester put on his skates and glided out
onto the ice. The scarf seemed to work at
first. His ears were warm. That was a good
thing.

But soon, Chester’s ears felt itchy. The
wool scarf made his ears itch!
The itch got worse and worse. Chester
couldn’t stand it. He took off the scarf and
his skates and ran home.

Chapter 3: A New Idea
Chester thought and thought. He needed
to put something warm over his ears. A scarf
was too itchy. What could he use?
Then he had an idea. Socks!
He found two socks. Next, he got some
wire and put it through the socks. Then he
tried on his invention. His ears felt warm.

But when Chester tried to skate, the socks
kept slipping off. Socks didn’t work.
Next, Chester made two wire circles.
He got some fur and some soft cloth. Then
he went to see his grandmother. Chester’s
grandmother was very good at sewing. He
needed her help.

Chester’s grandmother sewed fur on one
side of the circles and soft cloth on the
other side.
Chester put on his new ear warmers. He
smiled. He was sure that this big idea was
going to work.

The next day, Chester went to the pond
again. He was wearing his new ear warmers.
When Chester’s friends saw him, they
laughed. Chester didn’t mind. So far, his ears
were nice and warm!

Chester skated and skated. The cold wind
whistled, but Chester’s ears stayed warm.
Chester called his new invention
ear protectors.
Soon Chester’s friends wanted ear
protectors. Other people in the town
wanted ear protectors, too. Everyone wanted
warm ears.

Chester began to sell ear protectors. He
put a new, springy band on them. The band
helped to keep the ear protectors in place.

Chapter 4: Chester’s Factory
More and more people wanted to buy ear
protectors. So, when he was nineteen, Chester
opened a factory. His newspaper ads helped
sell many ear protectors in the United States.

Soon Chester began to sell his ear
protectors to people all over the world. The
ear protectors got a new name. People called
them earmuffs.

Chester became a famous inventor. He
invented a special rake, a teakettle that didn’t
tip over, a mousetrap, a bed that folded up,
and other things. Chester made more than 130
inventions. And it all began with earmuffs for
his big ears!

Today, a little town in Maine remembers
Chester Greenwood and his big idea. Every
year, one day in December is “Chester
Greenwood Day.”
People and animals march in a big parade.
And they all wear earmuffs!

=====================================================
120  Animals with
Wings

Robins, ducks, penguins, and bats are
different animals. But they all have wings!

Robins
Robins are birds that use their wings to
fly. They flap their wings up and down, up
and down, as they fly.
Robins have feathers on their wings. The
feathers help the robins fly. They keep the
robins warm, too.

Some robins fly away when the weather gets
cold. They fly to warm places where they can
find food. Later, robins fly back again.

Ducks
Ducks are birds that use
their wings to fly. A duck
has feathers on its wings,
just like a robin.

Some ducks also fly away when
the weather gets too cold. Ducks
spend a lot of time in the water.
They may travel thousands of miles
each year to find places where the
water does not freeze.

Penguins
Penguins are birds that have feathers on
their wings. But penguins do not use their
wings to fly. Penguins use their wings
to swim.

A penguin’s wings are like flippers. They
help the penguin swim through the water.
Penguins can swim very fast under the water.

These penguins live where the weather is
always cold. They do not swim away to warm
places. These penguins like cold places..

Bats
This animal is a bat. Bats are not birds,
but bats do have wings.
Bats do not have feathers. A bat’s body is
covered with fur. Its wings are covered with
smooth skin.

Some bats have very big wings. The wings
of the biggest bat are more than five feet long
from tip to tip.
Some bats have very small wings. This small
bat is about the size of a bumblebee.

At night, many bats fly around looking
for bugs to eat. They catch the bugs while
they are flying.

Bats sleep during the day. Bats have strong
claws on their feet. They use their claws to
hang upside down while they are sleeping.
They fold their wings up while they sleep.
