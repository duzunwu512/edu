061 Three Little Pigs and a Big Bad Wolf
Once there were three
little pigs.
They needed new homes.

The first little pig
made his house out of straw.
“What a fine house!”
he said.

The second little pig
made her house out of sticks.
“What a fine house!”
she said.

The third little pig
made his house out of bricks.
“What a fine house!”
he said.

One day a big bad wolf came
to the straw house.
“Let me in, little pig!”
he said.
“No!” said the first
little pig.

“Then I’ll huff and puff
and blow your house down,”
said the big bad wolf.
And he did.
The little pig ran away
to his sister’s stick house.

The next day the big bad wolf
went to the stick house.
“Let me in, little pigs!”
he said.
“No!” said the second
little pig.

“Then I’ll huff and puff
and blow your house down!”
said the big bad wolf.
And he did.
The little pigs ran away
to their brother’s brick house.

The next day the big bad wolf
went to the brick house.
“Let me in, little pigs!”
he said.
“No!”
said the third little pig.

“Then I’ll huff and puff
and blow your house down!”
said the big bad wolf.
And he tried.

The big bad wolf huffed
and he puffed.
But he could not blow
the brick house down!

So the big bad wolf
came up with a plan.

Down,
down,
down
he went!

But the three little pigs
had a plan, too.
“Hello, wolf!”
they said.

The big bad wolf ran away.
And the three little pigs
lived happily ever after!

“Hello,” called Goldie.
But no one answered.
“I wonder who lives here,”
said Goldie.
“I think I’ll go inside.”
And she did.

Goldie was hungry
from her walk.
She saw three bowls of soup
on the table.
She tried them all.

“This soup is too hot,”
said Goldie.
“This soup is too cold,”
said Goldie.

by the fireplace.

He said, “I have soft, black fur.
I have a long, bushy tail.
But I do not have white stripes
down my back.”

Brother Skunk said,

You do not have stripes,
so maybe you are not
a skunk.”

“She has soft, black fur
and a bushy tail.
But she has no stripes.
Maybe you are a cat.”

“Am I a cat?”

Maybe you are a squirrel.”

stubby tail,” said Little Skunk.

all by himself.
Then Bear heard
a noise.

Bear looked down.
A chair was coming up!
“We have chairs
for your tree house,”
said Owl.

“You were busy,”
said Bear.
“You were busy
helping me!”

083 The Gingerbread Man
Once upon a time,
a little old woman
and a little old man
lived deep in the woods.

One day, the little old woman said,
“Let’s make a gingerbread man.”
So they made the gingerbread,
and they cut out a man.

The little old woman
gave the gingerbread man
two eyes, a nose, and a mouth.
Then she put him
inside the oven to bake.

“I’m hungry!” said the little old man.
“Is the gingerbread man
ready to eat?”
“I’ll look,” said the little old woman.

The little old woman
peeked inside the oven.
The gingerbread man
jumped out.
“You can’t eat me!” he cried.
And he ran away.

“Come back!”
cried the little old woman.
“Come back!”
cried the little old man.
Then the little old woman
and the little old man
ran after the gingerbread man.

The gingerbread man ran and ran.
He laughed and said,
“Run, run, as fast as you can!
You can’t catch me.
I’m the gingerbread man!”

Down the road,
the gingerbread man
met a hungry pig.
“Stop! Stop!” cried the pig.
“I want to eat you!”

But the gingerbread man
laughed and said,
“Run, run, as fast as you can!
You can’t catch me.
I’m the gingerbread man!
I ran away from the little old woman.
I ran away from the little old man.
And I can run away from you.
I can! I can!”

Down the road,
the gingerbread man
met a hungry cow.
“Stop! Stop!” cried the cow.
“You look good to eat!”

But the gingerbread man
laughed and said,
“Run, run, as fast as you can!
You can’t catch me.
I’m the gingerbread man!
I ran away from the little old woman.
I ran away from the little old man.
I ran away from the pig.
And I can run away from you.
I can! I can!”

The gingerbread man came
to a river.
“Oh, no!” he cried.
“How will I get across?”

Then the gingerbread man
saw a fox.
“I can take you across,” said the sly fox.
“Jump on my tail.”
“No! You will eat me up,”
said the gingerbread man.
“No, I won’t,” said the sly fox.
“Jump on my tail.”

So the gingerbread man jumped
on the fox’s tail.
“I’m getting wet,”
said the gingerbread man.
“Jump on my back,”
said the sly fox.
“You will stay dry there.”

The gingerbread man jumped
on the fox’s back.
“I am getting wet,”
said the gingerbread man.
“Jump on my nose,”
said the sly fox.
“You will stay dry there.”

The gingerbread man jumped.
He jumped right into
the fox’s mouth!
“Yum!” said the sly fox.
And that was the end
of the gingerbread man!

“I like peanut butter
and jelly,” I said.
“I’ll have some
peanut butter and jelly.”

“They don’t have peanut
butter and jelly,”
said my mom.
“Do you want a pizza?
Do you want a hot dog
or some chicken soup?”

“No,” I said.
“I just want peanut butter
and jelly.
I’ll have lunch at home.”

We got the food.
It smelled good.

of his hot dog.

“That was a good lunch,”
said my grandma. “Let’s
go home.

I’ll give you some
peanut butter
and jelly.”

Maisy loved to eat.
Every day at dinner,
she ran to her dish.
She ate all her food
and begged for more.

Every day was the same.
Until one day ...

Dana put food
in Maisy’s dish.

at her food.
She didn’t eat one bite.

But Maisy wouldn’t eat.

The next day, Nate
put out food for Maisy.
Maisy looked at the food
in her dish.
But she still wouldn’t eat.

“Eat your dinner, Maisy,”
Nate said.
Maisy just sniffed the food
and walked away.

Nate and Dana were upset.
“Why won’t Maisy eat?”
Nate asked.
“She must be sick,”
said Dana.
“Don’t worry,” said Dad.
“We’ll take Maisy to
the vet.”

Maisy wagged her tail
when she saw Dr. Grant.
“What’s the matter?”
Dr. Grant asked.
“Maisy won’t eat,” said Dana.
“And you know Maisy.
She loves to eat!”

Dr. Grant checked Maisy.
“Maisy has gained
three pounds,”
said the doctor.
“She must be eating
something!”

They took Maisy home.
At dinner, she still
wouldn’t eat.

“Maybe this food is
too old,” Dad said.
“There are some new bags
of dog food in the basement.”

Nate and Dana went to get
a new bag of dog food.
“Oh, no!” said Nate.
“Look at all the dog food
that came out of the bags!”

Dana smiled.
“I know who did it,”
she said.
“Me too!” said Nate.

“Maisy!” called Nate
and Dana.

Gram was making a
scarf for Meg. Hugs liked
the yarn. He jumped on it.
Then he rolled over and over.
Hugs was having fun!

But Gram wasn’t having
any fun at all.
“Stop it, Hugs,” said Gram.
“Go and see what Meg is
doing.”

Meg was working on a
puzzle. So Hugs worked on
the puzzle, too. He jumped
on it. Then he pushed some
puzzle pieces and watched
them fall to the floor.

“Hugs! Stop!” said Meg.
“I can’t make this puzzle with
you on top of it!”
But Hugs was having too
much fun to stop.

“Okay,” said Meg. “Forget
the puzzle. I’ll play the piano.”
Hugs liked that plan.
Plunk! Plunk! PLONK!
He played the piano, too.

“Hugs! No!” Meg said.
“Get off the piano. Go and
see Gramps.”

Gramps was reading the
paper, but Hugs wanted to
play. Every time Gramps
turned a page, Hugs jumped
on it.

Soon the paper was ripped
to bits.

“Hugs needs something to
do,” said Meg. “It’s raining,
so he can’t play outside.”

“Well, we have to do
something,” said Gram.
“Yes! Just look at this
paper,” said Gramps.

“I know!” said Meg. “Let’s
make a new toy for Hugs.
Then he can play with his toy,
and we can watch a movie!”

tied lots of yarn to it. Meg
tied puzzle pieces to the yarn.
Gramps added bits of paper
and a bell.

popcorn. Gram started the
movie. And Meg gave the new
toy to Hugs.

Bear blew up the balloons.
He put the cake and the hats

Bear waited and waited,
but no friends came.
Bear was sad.
It was his birthday.
Where were his friends?
“I will go look for them,”
he said.

Bear went to Rabbit’s house.
Beaver and Fox were there.
“I’m sad,” Bear told them.
“I made a cake and party hats.
I blew up balloons.
Why didn’t you come to my
birthday party?”
“We did not come,” said Bear’s
friends, “because you did not
ask us!”
“Oh,” said Bear.
“I planned a party.
But I forgot to ask my friends
to come.”
“We will come now!” said Fox.

095 Stone Soup
Long ago, a young man
came into a poor little town.
All he had was a soup pot
and a spoon.
The man was very hungry.

The young man stopped
at a house.
He knocked at the door.
“I am cold and hungry,”
he said.
“May I have a bit of food?”

“This is a poor town,”
said the woman.
“We don’t have any food.
I’m sorry.”
Now, the woman had
some beans, but not enough
to share.

The young man went on until
he came to another house.
He knocked at the door.
“I am cold and hungry,”
he said.
“May I have a bit of food?”

“I’m sorry,” said an old man.
“This is a poor town.
We don’t have any food.”
Now, the old man had
a bit of meat, but not enough
to share.

The young man went on
and on from house to house.
All the people said
they were sorry.
But no one gave him any food.

“This is a poor town,”
they said.
“We don’t have any food.”
Now, all the people had
a little food, but not enough
to share.

The young man was still
very hungry.
So he came up with a plan.
First, he made a fire
right in the middle of town.
Then, he filled his pot
with water.
Next, he set the pot
on the fire.
Last, he picked up
a nice, round stone
and put it into his pot.

Steam rose from the pot.
The young man stirred and
stirred with his spoon.
“This stone soup looks good,”
he said loudly.
“Soon it will be ready to eat.”

People came out to see
what the young man was doing.
“What are you doing?”
they asked.
“I’m making stone soup,”
he said.
“I’ll give you some
when it is ready.
There will be plenty
for all of us.”

“How do you make stone soup?”
asked a girl.
“It’s easy,” said the young man.
“All you need is a stone.
But it would be so much better
with a few beans.”

“I have a few beans,”
a woman said.
The woman went off and got
the beans. She dropped them
into the pot.
“Mmm,” said the young man.
“Thank you.
This stone soup looks good.
But it would be
so much better
with a bit of meat.”

An old man said,
“I have a bit of meat.”
The old man went off and
got the bit of meat.
He dropped it into the pot.
“Thank you!” said the young man.
“Our stone soup is getting better
and better.”

“Do you want some carrots?”
asked a woman.
“I have some carrots.”
“Do you want a potato?”
asked a boy.
“I have a potato.”
“Do you want some corn?”
asked a man.
“I have a little corn.”

“Do you want some salt?”
asked the girl.
“I have some salt.”
“Yes, yes, yes, yes!”
said the young man.
So they all ran off
to get the food.

“Mmm,” said the young man.
“Now the soup is ready.
Get your bowls,
and we can all eat.”
“Mmm,” said the men.
“Mmm,” said the women.
“Mmm,” said the children.

“Thank you,” said all the people.
“Now we know how to make
stone soup.
We will never
be hungry again.”
The young man just smiled
and went on his way.

105 The Lion and the Mouse
One day, a Lion was taking a nap.
Soon, a little Mouse came running by.
He was in a hurry to get home.

The Mouse did not see the Lion.
So he ran right over the Lion’s nose!

The Lion woke up with a loud roar.
He grabbed the little Mouse
with his big paw.
“I’M GOING TO EAT YOU!”
roared the Lion.
“YOU WOKE ME UP!”

The Lion opened his big jaws.
He was going to eat
the little Mouse!
“Dear Lion, please do not eat me!”
said the Mouse.
“I did not mean to wake you up.
Please let me go!”

The little Mouse kept talking
and begging.
“Dear Lion, please,
please let me go!
If you do, maybe one day
I will help you.”

that he could not stop.
“You think you can help me?”
he asked.
“How could a little Mouse
ever help me?”

“What a funny little Mouse you are!”

to get free.
But he was trapped!

The little Mouse was close by.
He was taking a nap.
The Mouse woke up
when he heard the Lion roar.
“The Lion needs my help,” he said.
So he went to find the Lion.

The little Mouse saw the Lion
in the hunter’s net.
“I will help you, dear Lion,”
he said.
“Do not be silly, little Mouse,”
said the Lion.
“What can you do?
No one can help me now!”

“I can help you,”
said the little Mouse.
So the Mouse went to work.

He bit at the ropes
with his little teeth.
He bit and he chewed.
He chewed and he bit.
Then he bit and he chewed
some more.

It took the little Mouse a long time.
But at last, the Lion was free!
“How can I thank you?”
asked the Lion.
“What can I do for you?”

“Well, there is one thing,”
said the Mouse.
“I want to be your friend.”

107 The Three Billy Goats
Long ago, there were three goats named
Big, Middle, and Small.
Like all goats, they loved grass, and they
were always hungry for more.

One day, Small said, “Look over there,
across the river!”
The goats looked. They saw a big, green hill.
“That hill is so green!” said Middle.
“It must be covered with tasty grass.”
“That grass will make a fine lunch,”
said Big. “Let’s go there now!”

The goats reached the edge of the river.
They saw a sign. It said:
Warning! Troll Bridge! Do Not Cross!
“I don’t like trolls!” said Small.
“Neither do I!” said Middle.
“Don’t worry,” said Big. He pointed
under the bridge. “Look! We are
three smart goats, and I see only
one little troll. We can get across
that bridge.”

Small went first. As he trotted across the
bridge, his small feet made a small sound.
Trip-trap.
Trip-trap.
Trip-trap.
The troll woke up. “Who is crossing
my bridge?” he yelled.
“It’s only me!” said Small. “I want some
fresh grass to eat. Please let me go across.”

“No one may cross!” cried the troll.
“If you try, I will gobble you up!”
The little goat stopped to think.

“Please don’t do that,” said Small. “I am very
small and thin. Wait for my sister. She is
bigger. You will find her much more tasty.”
“Well,” said the troll. “All right then. Now
run away before I change my mind!”
So Small ran across the bridge.

Next came Middle. As she trotted across
the bridge, her middle-sized feet made a
middle-sized sound.
TRIP-trap.
TRIP-trap.
TRIP-trap.
“Who is crossing my bridge?” yelled the troll.
“It’s only me!” said the goat. “I want some
fresh grass to eat. Please let me go across.”

“No one may cross!” cried the troll. “If you
try to cross my bridge, I will gobble you up!”
“Please don’t do that,” said Middle. “Wait for
my brother. He is very big, and he will make
a much more tasty meal.”
“Well,” said the troll. “All right then.
Now run away before I change my mind!”
So Middle ran across the bridge.

Then came Big. As he trotted across
the bridge, his very big feet made a
very big sound.
TRIP-TRAP.
TRIP-TRAP.
TRIP-TRAP.
“Who is crossing my bridge?” yelled the troll.
“It’s only me!” said the goat. “I want some
fresh grass to eat. Please let me go across.”

The troll climbed up the bridge.
He saw Big. This goat was very big,
just as Middle had said.
“If you try to cross my bridge,
I will gobble you up!” cried the troll.
“I am very hungry, and you will make
a very nice lunch.”

“No, I won’t,” said Big. “I am bigger
than you, and I’m going to throw you
into the river.”
With that, Big put his head down.
Then he began to run. He ran
right into the troll and pushed him
off the bridge.
The troll fell into the river.

Then, Big crossed the bridge. He joined
Middle and Small on the hill.

109 Bad-Luck Day
Tia was about to have a
day she would never forget . . .
no matter how hard she tried!
Everyone in her family was
getting ready for work or school.
But not Tia—her alarm clock
had not gone off.

Later, the family was enjoying breakfast
—but not Tia.
The dog bumped the table.
Most of Tia’s cereal ended up
in her lap.

Tia changed her clothes
and stepped outside just in time
to see the school bus driving away.
“Great, just great,” whispered Tia.
“This is turning into a real
bad-luck day.”
Tia started walking.
But something was bothering her.
Had she forgotten something?

When she got to school,
Tia opened her backpack.
Her lunch and her homework
were missing.
All the kids turned in
their math homework
—but not Tia.

A row of cups sat by the window.
The wind blew one cup over.
On the side of this cup
was the name “Tia.”

Tia’s friend Gracie felt sorry for her.
“You’re having such a bad-luck day!
Here, take my lucky charm.
It will bring you good luck.”
“Thanks, Gracie,” Tia said.

Someone from the principal’s office
came into class with a bag
—Tia’s lunch!
Tia grinned.
“I think your charm is working!”
she whispered to Gracie.

On the way to lunch, Tia and Gracie
stopped to wash their hands.
The charm fell off Tia’s neck,
into the sink.
“I’d better keep it,” Gracie said nervously.
“It almost went down the drain.”

In the lunchroom, Tia didn’t see
the puddle of milk on the floor.
She slipped and fell with a crash.
Her sandwich fell right into the puddle.

Everyone was enjoying lunch
—but not Tia.
Gracie offered Tia half of her
tuna sandwich.
“My brother Tony surprised me.
He made the sandwich.
Here, take this half.”
Tia started to take a big bite.
Then she noticed something.

“A BUG!” Tia shrieked,
dropping the sandwich.
Gracie leaned down.
“It’s just a plastic worm,” she said.
“I knew Tony was up to something.”

Back in class, everyone else was reading
—but not Tia.
Her stomach rumbled.
She searched her backpack
for something to eat.
Tia found an old candy bar.
Finally, some good luck!
Then a shadow fell across Tia’s desk.

“I have to take that,” said the teacher.
“Candy is not allowed in class.
You know that.”
“I sure do,” sighed Tia.

When Tia got home, she ran to
her room and shut the door.
“I’ll just stay here for the rest
of the day,” she told the dog.
“That way, nothing bad
can happen.”
Tia called her friend Benny.
She told him about all the
bad things that had happened.

“I feel better talking to you,” said Tia.
“I think my bad luck has finally stopped.
What do you think, Benny?
. . . Hello? Benny?”
