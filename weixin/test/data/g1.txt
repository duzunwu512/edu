061 Three Little Pigs and a Big Bad Wolf
Once there were three
little pigs.
They needed new homes.

The first little pig
made his house out of straw.
“What a fine house!”
he said.

The second little pig
made her house out of sticks.
“What a fine house!”
she said.

The third little pig
made his house out of bricks.
“What a fine house!”
he said.

One day a big bad wolf came
to the straw house.
“Let me in, little pig!”
he said.
“No!” said the first
little pig.

“Then I’ll huff and puff
and blow your house down,”
said the big bad wolf.
And he did.
The little pig ran away
to his sister’s stick house.

The next day the big bad wolf
went to the stick house.
“Let me in, little pigs!”
he said.
“No!” said the second
little pig.

“Then I’ll huff and puff
and blow your house down!”
said the big bad wolf.
And he did.
The little pigs ran away
to their brother’s brick house.

The next day the big bad wolf
went to the brick house.
“Let me in, little pigs!”
he said.
“No!”
said the third little pig.

“Then I’ll huff and puff
and blow your house down!”
said the big bad wolf.
And he tried.

The big bad wolf huffed
and he puffed.
But he could not blow
the brick house down!

So the big bad wolf
came up with a plan.

Down,
down,
down
he went!

But the three little pigs
had a plan, too.
“Hello, wolf!”
they said.

The big bad wolf ran away.
And the three little pigs
lived happily ever after!

“Let’s play, boys,”
Papa said.
“See if you can kick
the ball past me.”

the ball into the net.
You were looking at ants.”

“I kicked the ball to you,”

your ants,” Sam said.

for a walk in the woods.
Soon she came to a little house.

The door was open.
“Hello,” called Goldie.
But no one answered.
“I wonder who lives here,”
said Goldie.
“I think I’ll go inside.”
And she did.

Goldie was hungry
from her walk.
She saw three bowls of soup
on the table.
She tried them all.

“This soup is too hot,”
said Goldie.
“This soup is too cold,”
said Goldie.
“This soup is just right,”
said Goldie.
So Goldie ate the soup.
And soon it was all gone.

Goldie was cold
from her walk.
She saw three chairs
by the fireplace.
She tried them all.

“This chair is too high,”
said Goldie.
“This chair is too low,”
said Goldie.
“This chair is just right,”
said Goldie.
So Goldie sat on the chair.
And she broke it.

Goldie was sleepy
and wanted a nap.
She saw three beds
in the bedroom.
She tried them all.

“This bed is too soft,”
said Goldie.
“This bed is too hard,”
said Goldie.
“This bed is just right,”
said Goldie.
So Goldie lay down
on the bed.
And she fell asleep.

Just then, the three bears
came home.
Baby Bear was hungry
from his walk.
So he got his soup bowl.

“My soup is all gone!”
cried Baby Bear.
“Who ate my soup?”
“I don’t know,”
said Mama Bear.

Baby Bear was cold
from his walk.
So he went to his chair
by the fireplace.
“My chair is all broken!”
cried Baby Bear.
“Who broke my chair?”
“I don’t know,”
said Papa Bear.

and wanted a nap.
So he went to his bed.

in my bed!”
cried Baby Bear.
“Who is that?”

“I don’t know,”
said Mama Bear.

said Papa Bear.
“And she’s fast asleep!”
